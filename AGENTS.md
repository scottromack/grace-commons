# AGENTS.md — Grace Commons session bootstrap

> Do not cut corners unless you have VERY good reasons and in that case ask.

> Standing instructions for any AI agent session working on Grace Commons, regardless of vendor or tool. (`CLAUDE.md` is a one-line shim pointing here, so Claude tooling and AGENTS.md-reading tools share this single source.) **This file is an agent-operational index and nothing more**: it points at the canonical documents and records environment quirks. It deliberately carries no canonical content — no vocabulary mirrors, no convention restatements, no library-state snapshots. Every rule it once mirrored now lives in exactly one canonical home, linked below. (The lesson that shaped this: every mirrored sentence in this file's CLAUDE.md-era predecessor eventually drifted from its source — stale counts, stale open-question lists, stale convention text. On 2026-06-11 the file was cut to pointers; the sections below that look like content are one-line redirects kept so historical "per CLAUDE.md §…" references in commit history still resolve — via the shim, they land here.)

## What Grace Commons is

A public library of **atoms** and **compositions** expressed as structured natural language: the spec is canonical, code is a derived build artifact. The thesis, philosophy, and inheritance are in [`the-spec-layer.md`](./the-spec-layer.md); the architecture overview is in [`why.md`](./why.md) (the vision page; `readme.md` is the site's Start Here landing/tour). Named for Grace Hopper, who first argued that business logic should be readable by the people who understand the business.

## Reading order for a fresh session

If you have no prior context, read in this order:

1. **[`why.md`](./why.md)** — architecture overview, atoms vs. compositions, the three-layers framing. Brief. (`readme.md` is the Start Here landing/tour — orientation for humans, not canon.)
2. **[`the-spec-layer.md`](./the-spec-layer.md)** — the manifesto. *Principles* and *Bridges* anchor the framing.
3. **[`pressure-testing.md`](./pressure-testing.md)** — the three-pass methodology, round structure and grounding semantics, formal-layer machinery, regulated-pattern conventions, capability provenance, the no-snapshot rule.
4. **[`spec-format.md`](./spec-format.md)** — the three spec shapes, required sections in order, and the cross-cutting authoring conventions (owned there as of 2026-06-11).
5. **[`contributing.md`](./contributing.md)** — contribution shape, the three perspectives, quality bar, lifecycle, the workflow for adding a new pattern, and the implementation-discovered-findings discipline.
6. **[`execution-contract.md`](./execution-contract.md)** — the deterministic compilation target: three primitives, four-step pipeline, atom-to-runtime mapping, conformance.
7. **An example atom.** [`atoms/personal-todo.md`](./atoms/personal-todo.md) (simplest shape); [`atoms/actor-identity.md`](./atoms/actor-identity.md) (regulated shape).
8. **An example application.** [`compositions/idempotent-reservation.md`](./compositions/idempotent-reservation.md) (two-atom); [`compositions/audit-trail.md`](./compositions/audit-trail.md) (the canonical regulated-audit stack).

When drafting a new pattern, additionally read the most structurally adjacent existing pattern — mirror its shape.

## Vocabulary — load-bearing terms

Moved — no mirror kept. Atom (atomic concept), composition, freestanding, and emergent invariant are defined in [`why.md`](./why.md); GRID, the three passes, `grounded`, and the Ledger in [`pressure-testing.md`](./pressure-testing.md); the three shapes and regulated overlay in [`spec-format.md`](./spec-format.md); strict spec-language terms in [`glossary.md`](./glossary.md).

## Authoring conventions

Moved — owned by [`spec-format.md`](./spec-format.md) §Cross-cutting authoring conventions (as of 2026-06-11). Deviations are review findings, not stylistic choices.

## The three-pass review

Moved — owned by [`pressure-testing.md`](./pressure-testing.md): pass definitions, §Order and iteration (round structure and naming; `grounded on Final Critique N` is the canonical marker), and §What "grounded" means (the formal-layer vote and Opus clearance gate).

## Regulated-pattern conventions

Moved — owned by [`pressure-testing.md`](./pressure-testing.md) §Regulated-pattern conventions (the two required sections and when they apply); section placement by [`spec-format.md`](./spec-format.md) §Regulated overlay.

## Current state of the library

Moved — [`roadmap.md`](./roadmap.md) is the single source of truth for counts, statuses, and sequencing; structural milestones are recorded on each pattern's roadmap row. The no-snapshot rule that used to live here is owned by [`pressure-testing.md`](./pressure-testing.md) §The no-snapshot rule.

## Workflow for adding a new pattern

Moved — owned by [`contributing.md`](./contributing.md) §Workflow for adding a new pattern (as of 2026-06-11).

## Open architectural questions

Moved — [`open-questions.md`](./open-questions.md) is the SSOT. No list is mirrored here: the last mirrored list in this file went stale (it carried two questions as open after they were resolved and executed on 2026-06-08).

## Implementation-discovered findings

Moved — owned by [`contributing.md`](./contributing.md) §Implementation-discovered findings (as of 2026-06-11). The one-line form: a **finding** names a contradiction inside the spec and routes through the review channel; everything else is a **preference** and belongs in the build's own tracker; builds proceed against the spec as written.

## Tone

Moved — the verbosity-preserves-meaning and bridges-over-walls principles are owned by [`the-spec-layer.md`](./the-spec-layer.md) (§The Architecture, §Principles, §Bridges); complete-over-concise and the reading tiers by [`spec-format.md`](./spec-format.md). The litmus test for any addition: *does this build a bridge, or does it build a wall?*

## Session hygiene

**Never commit!** When work is ready to commit, write the proposed commit message inline in the chat and stop. Do not run `git commit`. This rule has no exceptions — not for trivial fixes, not for "obvious" changes, not ever.

**Prompts go in chat, not files.** When asked for a prompt — for an AI adversarial review pass, a kickoff, a handoff, a sub-agent brief, anything — write it inline in the chat reply, as short as the task permits. Do **not** create prompt files in the repo. Prompts are ephemeral scaffolding; they carry no review pass, no Ledger, no authoring discipline, and they clutter the repo as content structurally indistinguishable from canonical patterns to any future reader (human or AI). Past sessions have written Round 3 / Final Critique review prompts as standalone files at the repo root; that was a mistake. The review's findings land in the pattern's Ledger as open lines, and the fixes in a commit whose message carries the reasoning; the prompt that drove the review stays in the chat where it was issued and is not committed.

The same rule applies to review *outputs*: a review's findings go into the pattern's Ledger as open lines (or are fixed, with the reasoning in the commit message), not into a standalone review file alongside the pattern.

The only prompt-shaped content that belongs in the repo is methodology — the three-pass question sets and authoring rubric in [`pressure-testing.md`](./pressure-testing.md). That content is canonical, reviewed, and edited like any other library document. Everything else is chat.

## Sandbox notes (environment-specific — not Grace Commons content)

Operational quirks of running this repo from a sandboxed or bridged session. These are environment facts, not canonical content, and do not apply to a local machine / Claude Code. Recorded so a session need not rediscover them. Two shapes exist, and they differ: the **Cowork Linux sandbox** (the repo mounted into the agent's own filesystem) and a **bridged cloud session** (the agent runs in a cloud container, the repo stays on the user's machine and is reached through a device shell). The notes below are marked where they diverge.

- **The formal harness needs Java 17, and the bootstrap must finish.** `node tools/harness/audit.mjs` checks `.tla` models with a bundled WASM checker (works out of the box) and `.als` (Alloy) models with `tools/alloy/alloy.jar`, which needs **Java 17** — the sandbox's system Java is 11, too old for Alloy 6. `tools/harness/bootstrap.sh` installs a JRE 17 to `/tmp/javajre` via npm; the unpack is large and **overruns a ~45-second command window**, and if it is cut off it leaves `jre/` without `lib/` (no `libjli.so`), so *every* `.als` fails with `libjli.so: cannot open shared object file` while `.tla` still passes. Fix: re-run the install until `/tmp/javajre/node_modules/javajre-linux-64/jre/lib/libjli.so` exists (it finishes even when the foreground call times out). Each Alloy model takes ~5–40s, so the full 74-model audit will not complete in one window — run `.als` in small batches.

- **Always pass `--no-optional-locks` to git.** Use `git --no-optional-locks status`, `git --no-optional-locks diff`, etc. on *every* git invocation. Any index-refreshing git command otherwise writes `.git/index.lock`, which the mount cannot `unlink` (see below), leaving a stale lock that blocks the user's next `git commit`. `--no-optional-locks` tells git not to take the optional index lock, so none is created in the first place. Prefer the Read/Grep/Glob file tools over git for inspecting changes when you can.

- **The mount blocks `unlink`.** `rm`, `git rm`, and any delete fail with *Operation not permitted* until the cowork delete-permission tool (`allow_cowork_file_delete`) is invoked once for the folder. Do **not** try to move a stuck `.git/index.lock` aside — `rename` "works" but only produces a second orphan you also can't remove, and it does not clear the real `.git/index.lock` (git just recreates it on the next index-touching call). The fix is to not create the lock at all (`--no-optional-locks`, above); if one already exists, clear it with `allow_cowork_file_delete` or have the user `rm` it locally. Separately, every `sed -i` / `perl -i` leaves a `.fuse_hiddenXXXX` orphan of the pre-edit file (these get swept into `git add -A` and corrupt rename detection — delete them before staging). `git mv` (rename) is unaffected.

- **~45 seconds per command, and background work does not reliably survive between calls.** Chunk long operations (npm installs, the full audit) rather than backgrounding them. *(Bridged session: the device shell allows longer — currently ~180 seconds — and each call is a fresh shell, so no working directory, variable or background job survives between calls. The full linter and the surface checker each finish inside one call; the conformance suite needs file globs, not directory arguments, under Node 22: `node --test tests/*.test.mjs ghost/tests/*.test.mjs`.)*

- **Bridged session: the repo is on the user's machine, and the cloud container is a different filesystem.** Work in the device shell, in place. Copying a spec into the cloud container to edit it and copying it back is how two versions of one file come to exist, and the user's own edits get overwritten by the stale copy. Cross the seam only for something the device cannot do — reading an image or a PDF page, a library that will not install there — and write the result straight back beside its source.

- **Bridged session: `git` writes locks the mount cannot always clean up, and the rule above still applies.** `--no-optional-locks` on every call. Delete permission for the repo folder can be requested once per session (the remote-devices delete-permission tool), after which `rm -f .git/index.lock .git/HEAD.lock` works — but the lock is best not created.
