# Conformance validator

The **level-1 feedback loop** as an artifact: point it at a running *render* (an
implementation) plus its spec-derived *manifest* and it returns a measured
`correctness(%)` — the fraction of the spec's checkable claims the render
provably honors, **counted, not asserted**.

It is the third checker in the trilogy, and shares their house style
(dependency-light, exit-coded, high-precision):

| tool | guards | reads |
|---|---|---|
| `tools/linter/lint.py` | the spec **prose** | cross-references in the markdown |
| `tools/harness/check.mjs` | the spec **proofs** | TLA+ / Alloy models |
| **`tools/conformance/`** | the spec **behaviour** | a render's records |

The **core** is dependency-free — Node ≥ 22 built-ins only (`node:sqlite`,
`node:crypto`); nothing to install. The one exception is **render 3**, which
exists to prove a genuinely different engine drops in: it uses `pglite` (real
Postgres-in-WASM). `npm install` in this folder fetches it; the validator,
evaluators, scorer, and renders 1–2 need nothing.

---

## Quickstart

```bash
cd tools/conformance

# 1. Build the render-1 store (see "The fixture" — no Deno needed in-sandbox).
node fixtures/build-clinical-trial-portal.mjs

# 2. Measure it.
node validate.mjs clinical-trial-portal
```

```
  CORRECTNESS: 100.0%   (20/20 passed)
  in-scope record-clearable: 20  ·  pass 20 · fail 0 · pending 0 · error 0
  critical-fail gate: clean (0 critical fails)
```

(Render 1 measured 95% until 2026-06-06, with one red — `C1-2b`, a real
audit-integrity bug the validator caught. The demo was patched; render 1 now
verifies clean. The catch-and-fix is the worked example below and in
[`discoveries.md`](../../discoveries.md).)

`--db <path>` measures any store (e.g. a live `deno task seed` DB);
`--json` emits a machine-readable report (for CI / the regen loop);
`--quiet` drops the per-check table.

**Exit codes** (house convention): `0` clean (no fail, no error) · `1` a
denominator check FAILED or an evaluator errored · `2` usage / load error.

---

## The four pieces

```
manifests/<render>.manifest.json   the structured oracle  (Day 1)
evaluators.mjs                     render-AGNOSTIC check logic, keyed by check id
adapters/<render>.adapter.mjs      the ONLY per-render code — a records-alone seam
validate.mjs  +  lib/score.mjs     the runner and the scoring kernel
```

- **Manifest** — one entry per *Generation-acceptance* check across the
  render's composition surface (C16 / C13 / C14 / APA / C1), each
  `{ id, claim (verbatim spec text), kind, render_scope, severity }`. It never
  names a table or an endpoint; it is stack-agnostic. Hand-authored for now;
  derive-from-prose is next-week.
- **Evaluators** — the check logic, written purely against the adapter contract
  in spec vocabulary (events, records, ordering). **No SQLite, no render
  knowledge.** This is why a second render needs *only* an adapter — the
  evaluators are shared.
- **Adapter** — the per-render seam: a small, **trusted**, read-only query layer
  that maps spec concepts onto *that* render's store. A wrong mapping makes a
  conformant render look broken, so it is small and reviewed. It only reads.
- **Runner + scorer** — load manifest → run each in-scope check through its
  evaluator against the adapter → tally → print. `lib/score.mjs` is the single
  implementation of the denominator rule and is unit-tested in isolation.

---

## The number (denominator rule)

The canonical, machine-readable definition lives in the manifest's
`denominator_rule` block. In short:

```
correctness(%) = (in-scope record-clearable checks that PASS)
                 ─────────────────────────────────────────────  × 100   (equal weight)
                 (in-scope record-clearable checks evaluated)
```

Two axes decide what counts:

- **`kind`** — the spec's own split, quoted verbatim from each Generation-
  acceptance section. `record-clearable` (an auditor can clear it from the
  records alone) is the only kind eligible for the denominator.
  `externally-clearable` (needs policy, a disclosure, or code inspection) is
  **reported separately, never scored**.
- **`render_scope`** — `out-of-scope` marks a check that is record-clearable in
  principle but reads composition substrate this render deliberately omits
  (credential-revocation cascade maps, a per-call authorization log, a
  cryptographic attestation store). Each carries a Demo2-plan citation. **Also
  reported separately, never scored** — so a render is never false-failed for a
  design decision it documented.

`pending` (no evaluator yet) and `error` (evaluator threw) are excluded from the
denominator, so a half-built run reports the honest fraction of what it actually
measured rather than deflating toward zero.

**Severity** never weights the percentage (equal weight, week 1). It drives
triage order and a *separate* gate reported beside the number:
`critical_fail_count == 0`.

For render 1 the manifest has 34 checks → **20 in the denominator**, 5
externally-clearable, 9 out-of-render-scope.

---

## Derive-from-prose (keeping the manifest honest)

The manifest is hand-authored — which invites the fair question *"did you
cherry-pick or misquote the checks?"* `extract-manifest.mjs` answers it
mechanically. It parses each composition's `## Generation acceptance` section
and pulls out the spec-**intrinsic** fields, which the spec decides, not the
author:

- `claim` — the verbatim bold lead of each GA check; in a spec written in
  GRACE lang, the first rule of each check (`Check 3.1: …`),
- `kind` — inferred from the GA section's own subsection headers and language
  ("External checks", "requires code inspection", …); an `External check`
  label is externally-clearable by its name,
- `ga_ref` — the check's position in the section, or its label (`Check 3`,
  `External check 2`).

It **cannot** derive the render-**specific** fields (`render_scope`, `severity`,
`scope_note`, `adapter_capability`) — those depend on what a given render
implements and stay a small, explicit, auditable overlay.

```bash
node extract-manifest.mjs ../../compositions/audit-trail.md --code C1   # emit checks
node extract-manifest.mjs --reconcile clinical-trial-portal             # diff vs manifest
```

`--reconcile` (exit-coded, reads `manifests/<render>.surface.json` for the
render's composition coverage) enforces three things:

- **claim faithfulness** — every manifest claim is verbatim-present in the spec
  prose (catches misquotes / invented checks),
- **completeness** — every spec GA check maps to a manifest entry (catches silent
  omissions; 1-to-many splits are allowed),
- **kind discipline** — a manifest `kind` that diverges from the spec-default is
  a *hard* finding **unless** the entry carries an explicit `kind_override`
  reason (a documented divergence is reported as info).

Render 1 reconciles at **0 drift findings** with **1 documented override**
(principal-binding is externally-clearable in the bare spec but
records-clearable here because render 1 composes Audit Trail). Running it after a
spec edit tells you immediately whether the manifest drifted. Full
auto-generation of the manifest from prose builds on this; today it keeps the
hand-authored manifest provably faithful.

---

## Proof it has teeth

A green run is meaningless unless the validator can go red. The default build is
correct (100%); inject a defect and watch the *right* check move — no false
greens, no false fails:

| build | correctness | reds |
|---|---|---|
| default (correct render) | **100%** | — |
| `--defect genesis-hash` | **95.0%** | `C1-2b` (chain diverges at event #1) |
| `--defect skip-grant-audit` | **95.0%** | `APA-1` (names grant 7) |
| `--defect tamper-payload` | **95.0%** | `C1-2b` (localized at the tampered row) |
| `--defect skip-grant-audit --defect genesis-hash` | **90.0%** | `APA-1`, `C1-2b` |

- The default at **100%** proves no ceiling artifact: a correct render scores full
  marks. Every drop below is an injected defect.
- `--defect genesis-hash` reproduces render 1's original bug (below); the chain
  diverges at event #1.
- `--defect skip-grant-audit` (writes a grant row but skips its audit append)
  flips **APA-1**, which names the exact offending grant.
- `--defect tamper-payload` (an adversary rewrites a committed payload) makes the
  hash chain diverge **at the tampered row** — the `tamper.test.ts` property,
  measured.

### The validator's first real catch — found, then fixed

On its first run against render 1, the validator returned 95% with one red,
`C1-2b`, and it was **not** synthetic. Render 1's seeded genesis event
(`study.registered`) was hashed in `scripts/seed.ts` **without** the `id` field,
while `domain/event_log.ts` `appendEvent`/`verifyChain` hash **with** `id`. The
genesis row therefore failed `verifyChain` on a *pristine* database — a CRA
clicking `/audit/verify` on an untampered store would have seen "Tamper detected
at event #1" — and because `verifyChain` stops at the first divergence, the
genesis break *masked* downstream tamper detection. The render's own tests never
exercised `verifyChain` over the seeded event, so the defect was latent until the
conformance run surfaced it on contact.

**Fixed in the demo on 2026-06-06** (`seed.ts` now hashes the genesis row with
`id`, matching the append path); render 1 verifies clean and measures 100%. The
bug is retained as a reproducible injection (`--defect genesis-hash`) and the
full account is in [`discoveries.md`](../../discoveries.md). This is the worked
example of the whole point: an oracle derived from the spec found a real
audit-integrity defect the implementation's own tests missed.

---

## Regen-fix loop

`regen.mjs` closes the level-1 loop: generate → check → fix → retest, until a
render clears a correctness threshold. The validator is the **fitness function**
— a candidate fix is kept only if it provably raises the measured number with no
regression.

```bash
node regen.mjs                 # climb a defective render to 100%
node regen.mjs --prove-guard   # show the fitness check REJECTS a regressive patch
```

```
  iter 0 — start: 90.0%   reds: [APA-1, C1-2b]
  iter 1 — addressing APA-1 ... 90.0% → 95.0%  KEPT
  iter 2 — addressing C1-2b ... 95.0% → 100.0% KEPT
  DONE — 100.0% after 2 fix(es). threshold cleared.
```

Two parts, with an honest line between them:

- The **driver** (measure → propose → apply → re-measure → keep-iff-improved →
  iterate) is the reusable contribution. It is render-agnostic and selects purely
  on the validator's number. `--prove-guard` demonstrates it is not vacuous: fed
  a deliberately regressive proposal it measures 95% → 90% and **reverts**,
  exiting non-zero rather than accepting a fix that games nothing.
- The **proposer** is the **LLM-pluggable seam**. In production an agent reads
  the reds plus the render source and writes a real patch. Here it is a small
  rule table that maps a red to the render edit addressing it (restore a skipped
  audit append; align the genesis hash) — keyed off the red's content, not
  knowledge of which defect was injected. The "render" is the faithful fixture
  and a "patch" is an edit to its build-state; the live demo is never touched.

## Plugging in a new render

The whole point of the adapter seam: a second render drops in by writing **one
file**.

1. **Write `adapters/<render>.adapter.mjs`** — default-export
   `createAdapter({ dbPath }) → adapter`, implementing the read-only,
   synchronous contract documented at the top of `evaluators.mjs`
   (`events`, `eventsByAction`, `verifyChain`, `grants`, `sessions`,
   `onboardingCompletions`, …). Map spec concepts onto your store; keep it
   small and reviewed (it is trusted).
2. **Write `manifests/<render>.manifest.json`** — same shape as render 1's;
   set each check's `render_scope` honestly against what your render implements.
3. `node validate.mjs <render> --db <your store>`.

The evaluators and the scorer are unchanged. If a check needs a records-alone
accessor your adapter doesn't yet expose, add it to the contract (and to every
adapter) — that keeps the evaluators render-agnostic.

---

## Multi-render agreement (the thesis number)

A spec claim is *carried by the spec* only if it holds identically across
**independent** renders of the same surface. There are seven:

| render | engine | schema / vocabulary | password | chain |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `clinical-trial-portal`        | SQLite (Deno)  | render-1 names              | Argon2id | correct (genesis bug fixed 2026-06-06) |
| `clinical-trial-portal-next`   | SQLite (Node)  | `people`/`ledger`/`auth.ok` | scrypt   | correct |
| `clinical-trial-portal-pg`     | **Postgres** (pglite) | `members`/`audit`/`signin.ok` | pbkdf2 | correct |
| `clinical-trial-portal-r4`     | flat-file **JSONL** | append-only log, no SQL | hashed | correct |
| `clinical-trial-portal-nextjs` | **Postgres** (pglite), Next.js-shaped | `party`/`audit_event`/`auth.login_ok` | scrypt | correct |
| `clinical-trial-portal-next-app` | **the real deployable app** — `demos/clinical-trial-portal-next` (Next.js App Router + Postgres) | render-1 names (faithful port) | scrypt | correct |
| `clinical-trial-portal-mongo` | **MongoDB** (mongodb-memory-server) — `demos/clinical-trial-portal-mongo` | render-1 names (faithful port) | scrypt | correct |

The **same** manifest, **same** evaluators, and **same** ghost scenario drive all
seven — only the per-render adapters differ. **Two** of them (`-r4`, `-nextjs`)
were authored by agents with **isolated context** that never saw the other
renders — only the spec + the adapter contract — so their convergence is
independent-derivation evidence, not shared lineage. The **sixth**
(`-next-app`) is not a conformance fixture at all: it is the actual deployable
demo's own store, validated by pointing the harness at the real app — so the
thesis number is measured against shipping code, not a test double. The
**seventh** (`-mongo`, `demos/clinical-trial-portal-mongo`) is the first
**document-store** render — no foreign keys, no CHECKs, no schema-level delete
discipline — built to discover where each Postgres-carried invariant moves when
the declarative layer disappears (its README carries the invariant → enforcer
table, and it supplies the **fourth** conforming mechanism for the Event Log
serialize clause: replica-set transaction + unique `_id` + optimistic retry).

```bash
node fixtures/build-clinical-trial-portal.mjs   # render 1
node render2/build.mjs                          # render 2 (same scenario)
node render3/build.mjs                          # render 3 (Postgres)
node render4/build.mjs                          # render 4 (JSONL, independently authored)
node render5/build.mjs                          # render 5 (Next.js+Postgres, independently authored)
# render 6 = the real app's store: (cd demos/clinical-trial-portal-next && node scripts/migrate.ts && node scripts/seed.ts)
# render 7 = the Mongo ghost render: (cd demos/clinical-trial-portal-mongo && npm install && node build.mjs)
T=$(node -e 'console.log(require("os").tmpdir())')/grace-commons-conformance
node agree.mjs clinical-trial-portal \
  clinical-trial-portal clinical-trial-portal-next \
  "clinical-trial-portal-pg=$T/clinical-trial-portal-pg" \
  "clinical-trial-portal-r4=$T/clinical-trial-portal-r4.jsonl" \
  "clinical-trial-portal-nextjs=$T/clinical-trial-portal-nextjs" \
  "clinical-trial-portal-next-app=../../demos/clinical-trial-portal-next/data/pg" \
  "clinical-trial-portal-mongo=$T/clinical-trial-portal-mongo"
```

```
  clinical-trial-portal            100%
  clinical-trial-portal-next       100%
  clinical-trial-portal-pg         100%
  clinical-trial-portal-r4         100%
  clinical-trial-portal-nextjs     100%
  clinical-trial-portal-next-app   100%
  clinical-trial-portal-mongo      100%
  CROSS-RENDER CORRECTNESS: 100%   (20/20 pass on EVERY render)
    agreed-pass 20 · agreed-fail 0 · DISAGREE 0
```

All 20 claims hold identically across seven independent renders spanning SQLite,
Postgres, a flat-file log, MongoDB, and the real deployable app — spec-carried
meaning, fully measured. `agree.mjs`
(N renders) exits non-zero on any disagreement, so it doubles as a CI gate on
spec-carried behavior. Each new render joined by writing **only two adapters** (a
validator adapter + a ghost actions adapter) — no new evaluators, no new
manifest. Render 3 also shows the seam absorbs an **async** engine: its validator
adapter loads Postgres into memory once, then serves the same synchronous
accessor contract.

**Disagreement localizes defects — and once did.** Until 2026-06-06 render 1
carried the genesis-hash bug, and agreement read 19/20 with the lone disagreement
naming `C1-2b` on render 1 alone — out-voted 3-to-1, the divergence pinning the
defect to one render rather than the spec. That demonstration is reproducible:
rebuild render 1 with the bug injected and agreement drops accordingly —

```bash
T=$(node -e 'console.log(require("os").tmpdir())')/grace-commons-conformance
node fixtures/build-clinical-trial-portal.mjs --defect genesis-hash --out "$T/r1-bug.db"
node agree.mjs clinical-trial-portal \
  "clinical-trial-portal=$T/r1-bug.db" clinical-trial-portal-next \
  "clinical-trial-portal-pg=$T/clinical-trial-portal-pg" \
  "clinical-trial-portal-r4=$T/clinical-trial-portal-r4.jsonl"
#  → CROSS-RENDER CORRECTNESS 95%, DISAGREE 1: C1-2b on clinical-trial-portal only
```

## The fixture (why it's generated, not committed)

The demo runs on Deno (jsr: imports, Argon2id WASM), which isn't present in this
sandbox, and the checked-in `dev.db` carries only the stale seed event. So
`fixtures/build-clinical-trial-portal.mjs` replays render 1's documented
lifecycle (Demo2-plan §0) into a SQLite store using the render's **actual
schema** (`migrations/0001_init.sql`, exec'd verbatim) and a **byte-faithful
port** of its event/hash construction — faithfulness was originally checked by
reproducing seed.ts's exact stored hash, genesis bug and all (the bug it then
caught). The default build now mirrors the **patched** seed; `--defect
genesis-hash` reproduces the original. The store is built onto the
native tmp FS (SQLite can't host a live DB on the mounted repo FS) and the runner
defaults `--db` there; it is never committed. **When Deno is available, skip the
fixture and point `--db` at a real `deno task seed` store** — the validator code
is identical either way.
