Grace Commons spec-corpus linter — the mechanical cross-reference checker.

The spec layer has no compiler. This is a partial one: a dependency-free static
pass over the atoms/ and compositions/ markdown that catches the classes of drift
the three-pass review otherwise has to catch by eye —

  A. Dangling links        — every relative .md/.tla/.als/.cfg link resolves to
                              a real file (a renamed model leaving a spec→.tla
                              link dangling is the class this caught).
  B. Invariant-count refs   — "all N invariants from <Pattern>" matches the
                              actual count of `**Invariant N —**` headers in
                              <Pattern>. (The nine-vs-ten drift hazard.)
  C. Model-present bar      — a Status line that names a `.tla`/`.als` model has
                              that file present AND a `-buggy` twin beside it.
  D. Stale forthcoming      — a `*(forthcoming)*` marker in a list item that also
                              links to a file which is already `grounded`.
  E. Count honesty          — "NN grounded patterns / NN compositions" claims in
                              roadmap.md and readme.md match the real file counts.
  F. Rests-on refs          — a "<Pattern> Invariant N" cross-reference (as used in
                              invariant *Rests on:* clauses) resolves: N <= the cited
                              pattern's real invariant count. The tractable mechanical
                              slice of the capability-provenance rule (pressure-testing.md
                              §Capability provenance); the broader "is this capability
                              actually declared by that constituent" check stays
                              fresh-reader Pass-2 work (paraphrased names defeat a regex).
  G. Status grammar         — every pattern has a `## Status` section whose first
                              line starts with exactly one backticked status token
                              conforming to the pinned grammar (pressure-testing.md
                              §Status line format, pinned 2026-06-11).
  H. Status mirror          — a roadmap.md list entry that links a pattern and carries
                              a backticked status token mirrors the pattern file's own
                              token exactly (the pattern file is the source of truth).
  I. Duplicate table rows   — no roadmap.md table names the same pattern twice
                              (the duplicated-Login-row class).
  J. Banned working noun    — "concern" (any case, any inflection) is banned
                              corpus-wide as working vocabulary (vocabulary
                              directive 2026-06-11: the unit of separation is the
                              *concept*; pre-triage items in the guided tool are
                              *candidate concepts*). The single permitted form is
                              the title-case proper noun "Separation of Concerns"
                              naming the ancestor principle (inheritance map,
                              glossary tombstone) — mention of the ancestor,
                              never working use. Scans the whole corpus, not just
                              the pattern dirs.
  K. Output-level noun      — "application(s)" is output-level vocabulary (a
                              deployed build output) and is banned in the
                              canonical layer: atoms/, compositions/, the core
                              docs, and tools/guide. The canonical layer has
                              exactly two artifact kinds — atomic concepts and
                              compositions thereof. Not scanned: execution-
                              contract.md (the output level is its domain),
                              roadmap.md (dated history), glossary.md (the
                              definition site). Inline code spans and the API
                              acronym's canonical expansion are scrubbed first
                              (naming an external project's literal
                              `applications/` directory, or glossing API, is
                              mention, not use).
  L. Bare C-number          — no bare composition C-number (C1–C19) survives in an
                              atom/composition live body; the name carries the
                              meaning, the C-number is a registry key (debt #14).
                              Example `credential Cn` IDs are scrubbed; root policy
                              docs that cite `Cn` as an example are out of scope.
  M. Internal sigils        — no coined finding-ID sigil (FCn, FC-Fn, MC-Cn-N,
                              Rn-Fn, Cn-N, OG-n) survives in an atom/composition
                              live body (debt #15, naming.md Rule zero). High
                              precision: these shapes have no legitimate collision.
  P. Atomicity over audit   — an all-or-nothing claim ("together or not at all")
                              whose member set names an audit write, with no
                              acknowledgement in the enclosing block that an
                              appended event cannot be withdrawn. The first
                              mechanical slice that polices a *use* of a
                              constituent capability rather than a claim about
                              one (pressure-testing.md §Capability provenance,
                              widened 2026-08-27). The phrase alone is not the
                              signal — most uses of it are benign, over
                              constituent-store writes only.
  Q. Rebuild totality bound — a `*Rebuild procedure:*` that reads an event
                              payload with no stated bound on its own totality.
                              The substrate's purge cascade destroys Event Log's
                              `data` in its entirety at the retention horizon, so
                              an unbounded rebuild claims something that stops
                              being true on a schedule the composition does not
                              control. Exemplar: Audit Trail's "Bound on the
                              rebuild's totality, stated rather than assumed".
  S. Recording-failure step — in a composition that composes Audit Trail, a bare
                              `recording-failure` on the left of a mapping arrow
                              (→), on a line that also names `record_action`,
                              above the Status section. The substrate's contract
                              carries the step that refused — step-4 means the
                              event is already appended, so a retry that cannot
                              see the step duplicates outcome events. A bare
                              token in that position is a transcription of the
                              substrate arm with its payload dropped
                              (pressure-testing.md §A transcribed rejection arm
                              keeps its payload, frozen 2026-08-29). Signature
                              blocks, examples, prose, and a peer composition's
                              own bare arm mapped on a line with no substrate
                              call are not flagged: compositions re-export
                              `recording-failure` bare at their own boundary.
  T. Seal presentation key  — an `original_event_payloads` map subscripted or
                              described as keyed by an identifier (`[event_id]`,
                              `[entry_id]`, "keyed by `disclosure_id`"). The
                              record set a seal commits to is a sequence range
                              (Audit Trail Invariant 7), so a map keyed by an id
                              can present at most one payload per event and
                              every verification under interval cadence returns
                              a seal-record-set mismatch (pressure-testing.md
                              §A seal presentation is keyed by log position,
                              frozen 2026-08-29). Bare-payload `verify_record`
                              calls are NOT flagged — the substrate's own
                              contract uses the singular parameter name.
  U. Retry bit at boundary   — within one action's numbered step list, in a
                              composition that composes Audit Trail, a bare
                              `rejected(recording-failure)` landed at a step
                              BEFORE the action's first qualified constituent
                              commit call and at a step AFTER it. Read calls
                              (`read`, `read_record`, `check`, `verify_*`,
                              `history_for`, `active_for`, …) and
                              `AuditTrail.record_action` (the intent record) do
                              not count as the commit. One token on both sides
                              of the commit tells the caller nothing about
                              whether a retry is safe (pressure-testing.md
                              §A composition's own rejection arm carries the
                              retry bit, frozen 2026-08-30). Landed advisory
                              2026-08-30 (baseline: 10 actions, 5 patterns) and
                              promoted to gating the same day at zero sites.
  O. Term registry resolver — on any page carrying an annotation.md `## Terms`
                              registry, every `[Term]` shortcut-reference marker
                              resolves to a `[Term]: …` definition (no dangling)
                              and every definition is used (no orphan). OPT-IN:
                              pages with no Terms section are skipped, so the
                              not-yet-converted patterns stay at 0 and recall
                              grows as pages convert. The safety net for the
                              annotation.md bulk rollout. (Whitelist gloss is N.)

Design notes (this tool is meant to be maintained by a small/cheap model):
  - Standard library only. No deps. Runs anywhere `python3` does.
  - High precision over high recall: a false positive costs trust, so each check
    fires only on a tight, well-understood pattern. Recall grows by adding
    checks, not by loosening existing ones.
  - One finding per line, machine-greppable. Exit 1 if any finding, 0 if clean.

# Checks that REPORT but do not fail the build. A new check landed against an
# existing corpus starts here: it is worth reading from the day it lands, and
# turning the continuous-integration gate red before the findings it names have
# been worked is how a check gets muted rather than fixed. A code leaves this
# set when its findings reach zero — that is the moment the check starts
# defending the property instead of measuring it.
#
# P-atomic-audit and Q-rebuild-bound landed 2026-08-27 with a recorded baseline
# (roadmap.md methodology debt #19): 3 patterns and 8 patterns respectively.
# Their propagation is debt #19 step (iii); they become gating when it closes.
# EMPTY as of 2026-08-27: both checks are gating. Q-rebuild-bound was promoted
# when the retention-horizon class closed on every known instance — including the
# two its own trigger cannot see (Preference-Aware Notification Fanout and
# Forensic Recovery's AP-F1), which is the distinction the promotion waited on.
# A check going silent measures the check's reach, not the corpus's health, so
# silence alone was never the bar; the bar was the class.
#
# P-atomic-audit was promoted to GATING on 2026-08-27, when the last of its three
# instances closed and it fired zero times corpus-wide. That is the condition
# roadmap.md set for promotion: a check becomes gating at the moment it stops
# measuring a backlog and starts defending a property. From here a firing means a
# NEW instance has been introduced, which is exactly the event that should stop a
# build — the class took three rounds and one protocol repair to clear, and
# re-acquiring it silently is the failure mode worth spending a red build on.
#
# S-recording-step and T-seal-key landed 2026-08-29 ADVISORY with a recorded
# baseline (23 sites across 6 patterns; 1 site) — the same discipline P and Q
# followed: a check measuring a backlog is advisory, and becomes gating at the
# moment the sweep under its rule empties it. The rules they police were frozen
# on the day the checks landed (pressure-testing.md, the six sections stated
# 2026-08-29), so the sweep's findings are attributable to a rule that already
# covered them. Promotion is the removal of the code from this set, in the same
# change as the last site's fix, with test_checks.py's pin set switched to exact.
#
# T-seal-key was promoted to GATING on 2026-08-29, the same day it landed: its
# one site (Immutable Transaction Ledger's [Verify Ledger]) closed under the
# sweep and it fires zero times corpus-wide. S-recording-step followed the same
# day: its baseline of 22 sites across five patterns (23 before the peer-arm
# correction) closed under the sweep — External Onboarding, Propagate Consent
# Revocation Downstream, Immutable Transaction Ledger, Capability-Backed
# Sharing, Actor Suspension — and it fires zero times corpus-wide.
# EMPTY as of 2026-08-29: every check is gating.
#
# U-retry-bit landed 2026-08-30 ADVISORY with a recorded baseline of 10 actions
# across 5 patterns (Capability-Backed Sharing, Chain of Custody, Customer
# Onboarding, Forensic Recovery, Immutable Transaction Ledger) — two of them
# patterns the second gates had already closed. Same promotion discipline: it
# becomes gating in the change that closes the last site.
#
# U-retry-bit was promoted to GATING on 2026-08-30, the same day it landed: the
# three third-gated sites closed under the sweep and the two second-gated ones

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# The third mechanical slice of the capability-provenance rule, and the first
# that polices a *use* rather than a claim (pressure-testing.md §Capability
# provenance, widened 2026-08-27). A composition that says a write set "commits
# together or not at all" is claiming a withdrawal capability over every member
# of that set. Where a member is an Audit Trail write, the substrate declares
# the opposite: an appended event cannot be withdrawn and synchronous rollback
# is unavailable to it. The claim is then an undeclared dependency of exactly
# the kind the rule forbids — invisible because nothing on the page announces it.
#
# Precision over recall, per the linter's division of labor:
#   - the phrase alone is NOT the signal. Nine patterns use "together or not at
#     all" and most do so benignly, over constituent-store writes only. The
#     check fires only where the SAME SENTENCE also names an audit write.
#   - a pattern that has already done the honest restatement is not flagged.
#     Chain of Custody's Invariant 4 states the safety-plus-liveness split
#     outright ("synchronous rollback is unavailable … the orphan state *is*
#     reachable … The honest claim therefore splits"), and Resolve a Person's
#     Data Rights carries a modulo-clause for its irreversible precursor. Any
#     acknowledgement marker in the enclosing block suppresses the finding —
#     the check asks "is the un-withdrawable half acknowledged anywhere near
#     this claim", not "is the wording ideal".
#   - the fix a firing asks for is a restatement, never a rewiring: order the
#     un-withdrawable write last, claim "no sealed event without its record" as
#     safety and "no record without its sealed event, within a declared
#     compensation window" as liveness. The in-corpus exemplar is Chain of
#     Custody Invariant 4.

# Q-rebuild-bound — a payload-sourced rebuild claiming totality it cannot have
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# The fourth mechanical slice, and the second that polices a use. A composition
# whose derived-index rebuild reads fields out of audit event payloads is using
# a capability the substrate lawfully withdraws: the purge cascade destroys
# Event Log's `data` field in its entirety at the retention horizon. A rebuild
# stated without a bound on its own totality therefore claims something that
# stops being true on a schedule the composition does not control — and the
# consequence is not always cosmetic (in one pattern a purged payload lets one
# human approval authorize a second regulated firing).
#
# Precision over recall:
#   - fires only on an explicit `*Rebuild procedure:*` clause that names a
#     payload read. A rebuild described in prose is missed; that is a recall
#     gap, deliberately taken, because a looser trigger would fire on every
#     "for every event" in the corpus.
#   - any bound marker in the enclosing block suppresses it. The in-corpus
#     exemplar is Audit Trail's "Bound on the rebuild's totality, stated rather
#     than assumed" — which then states the bound and why it suffices.
#   - atoms owning their own store are unaffected: they are not reading a
#     substrate payload they do not control.
#
# Known recall gaps, recorded rather than chased. Preference-Aware Notification
# Fanout reads payload fields with the phrasings "every fact in the index is a
# `fanout.created` event's (principal_ref, decided_at, channels) triple" and
# "the `fanout.initiated` event carries the invocation's scope" — both genuine
# instances this check does not see. Widening the trigger to "event carries" /
# "event's (tuple)" catches them AND produces a false positive on Audit Trail's
# own `event_to_sequence`, whose rebuild reads `event_id` and `sequence_number`
# — fields the purge cascade PRESERVES, so no bound is owed. That is the real
# shape of the test: not "does it touch a payload" but "does it read a field
# the cascade destroys", which needs the surviving-field set (action_ref,
# actor_ref, attested_at, attestation_id, recorded_at, sequence_number,
# event_id) subtracted from what the clause names. Until a check can do that
# subtraction, this one stays tight and the gap stays written down — the
# linter's rule is that recall grows by adding checks, not by loosening one
# until it matches the answer you expected.

# LINE-SCOPED, and this is a recorded recall gap rather than an oversight: a spec
# that wraps its rebuild procedure across lines is invisible to this check. Corpus
# state bullets are single long lines, so the gap is latent today.
#
# It is left open on evidence, not on caution. Widening the clause to run to the
# end of its paragraph was tried 2026-08-27 and is wrong: markdown list items sit
# on adjacent lines with no blank line between them, so a paragraph-scoped clause
# swallows the following bullets — and doing so silently DROPPED a real finding
# (multi-party-approval's `chain_to_events`), because an over-captured clause
# picked up a negation from a later bullet and the polarity guard suppressed it.
# A recall fix that costs precision on live findings is not a fix. The correct
# form stops at the next list item; it is not attempted while this class is
# mid-flight, because retuning a trigger over careful prose is what produced both
# of this file's earlier regressions.

# from a PEER composition's call: Multi-Party Approval, Immutable Transaction
# Ledger and their kin re-export `recording-failure` bare at their own caller
# boundary, so a composer transcribing that arm is transcribing it correctly.

# Ledger grammar and census (R)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#
# The Ledger is the countable single source of truth for a pattern's health
# (open-questions.md §Replace the prose Lineage; pressure-testing.md §Where the
# journey gets recorded). Its grammar is fixed so this file can parse it:
#
#   ## Ledger
#
#   ```
#   status: <token — identical to the Status line's token>
#   formal: <verified — model.tla + N twin(s), YYYY-MM-DD | pending — <why> |
#            not applicable — <why>>
#   last gate: <YYYY-MM-DD — <kind> — <result>> | none
#
#   open:
#   - <YYYY-MM-DD-x> · <foundational|refining|rhetorical> · <where> · <defect> → <fix>
#   ```
#
# `open: none` when nothing is open. When a finding closes its line is deleted;
# the fact that it existed is in git. Derived rules the check refuses by
# construction: a grounded token with an open foundational line; a Ledger
# status that disagrees with the Status line; an open line with the wrong
# field count, an unknown class, a malformed or duplicate id.
