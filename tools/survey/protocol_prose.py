"""Protocol prose per composition — the recurrence and deletion baseline for the
higher-order composition test (pressure-testing.md section Pass 2, *The higher-order
composition test*; roadmap.md methodology debt #20).

Six components make up the recoverable-invocation shape every regulated composition
re-derives in its own words: an intent/outcome record pair, a serialized section
(or lease) on the act, a completion bound, a bounded reconciliation, a recovery
record or identity, and a rejection code that carries its position. This survey
counts, per composition body (above ## Status), which of the six are present and
how many bytes of paragraphs touch at least two of them — a rough upper bound on
the protocol prose an adopter would replace with a dependency declaration and its
bindings. Re-run after an adoption: the number falling is the deletion evidence
the seventh rule of the test requires.

2026-08-30 baseline: twenty compositions carry three or more components; ~920 KB of
protocol prose; per-body share 8% (Privileged Access Provisioning) to 55% (Actor
Suspension); nine carry all six.
