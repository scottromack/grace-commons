> The deterministic compilation target for Grace Commons atoms and compositions. Every atom is a state machine whose transitions execute via a fixed four-step pipeline over two effect channels and two pure-function boundaries. Nothing else is permitted at runtime.

This document is the contract between the Grace Commons spec layer and any runtime that claims to implement it. It names the three primitives, defines the pipeline, specifies the mapping from atom spec sections to compilation targets, and defines what conformance means. A-stack — the reference implementation in Deno + PostgreSQL + JSX — is the worked instantiation of the contract, not the contract itself. Any runtime that satisfies the contract is a conforming implementation.

---

## Core claim

Every Grace Commons atom compiles into a single explicit state machine. Every transition of that state machine executes through the same four-step pipeline — read current state, evaluate guards, write new state, project output — in that order, with no deviations and no additional steps. No runtime behavior exists outside this pipeline. That is the entire system.

---

## Logic Confinement Principle

The overwhelming majority of async, consistency, timing, and correctness problems in software originate from behavioral logic leaking into the wrong layers. Grace Commons enforces a strict confinement discipline across all conforming implementations. The three primitives and the four-step pipeline below are its concrete expression.

**1. Core is pure.** All atom and composition logic is synchronous, deterministic, and side-effect-free. No IO, no time sources, no randomness, no cryptography inside core logic. If it feels like it should be async, it belongs outside core.

**2. Single seam rule.** Every mutation crosses exactly one transactional boundary. No business logic is permitted in route handlers, middleware, or adapters. The composition layer is the seam; handlers are plumbing.

**3. Explicit inputs only.** Time (`clock_t`), identifiers (`id_t`), and cryptographic material are injected as explicit inputs — never generated inside G or T. A transition function that calls `Date.now()` or `crypto.randomUUID()` internally is non-deterministic by construction. The pipeline makes both reads explicit direct effects — the clock at the top of Step 2 (one reading per invocation, shared by G and T), entropy at the top of Step 3, before T runs.

**4. Behavior as data transformation.** Prefer explicit construction over hidden work inside transactional functions. The pattern is: construct the value outside the boundary, pass it in, append it. Hidden side effects inside transactions are where correctness guarantees degrade silently.

**5. Local, checkable invariants.** Every critical rule is asserted in the smallest possible scope. Distributed or implicit assumptions — "appendEvent always ensures X" — are replaced with named invariants in the spec and named assertions in the compiled test suite.

**6. Async at the edge only.** All asynchronous, network, storage, and external work is confined to adapters. The pipeline itself — Steps 1 through 4 — is synchronous. Async enters core and complexity grows nonlinearly; Grace Commons eliminates the category by construction.

**Current status.** The Beacon reference implementation satisfies rules 1, 2, 3, and 6 fully — against rule 3 as it stood when Beacon was built: Beacon reads the clock at Step 3, predating the 2026-07-12 placement revision (clock read at the top of Step 2, shared by G and T — see Pipeline). The injection principle holds in Beacon; the step-placement update rides the same projector build phase as rules 4 and 5. Rule 4 (explicit construction / `createEvent` before `appendEvent`) and rule 5 (compiler-emitted invariant assertions) are targeted for the projector build phase — the gap is tracked as methodology debt #7 in [`roadmap.md`](./roadmap.md) §Methodology debts (the projector / verification-harness deliverable). The principle is stated here as a first-class commitment, not a retrospective description of the demo.

## The three primitives

### State Machine (SM)

A state machine is defined as a six-tuple:

```
SM = (S, E, T, G, I, Q)
```

- **S** — the finite set of named states. Maps to the atom's State section (state names only).
- **E** — the set of typed events, one per action. Maps to the atom's action signatures.
- **T** — the transition function: `S × E × Params × clock_t × id_t → S`. The body of T is a direct effect (a database write); T itself is deterministic given its inputs. `clock_t` and `id_t` are injected — see Pipeline below.
- **G** — the guard function: `S × E × Params × clock_t → pass | typed_failure(reason)`. G is a pure function. It takes `state_t` (read in Step 1), the event parameters, and the injected clock reading `clock_t` (read as a direct effect at the top of Step 2 — see Pipeline below); it returns either pass or a typed rejection. `clock_t` is what temporal guards evaluate against: a reject-future-timestamp bound or an ordering check against a stored timestamp is a comparison between explicit inputs, never an internal clock read. The typed failure space is exactly the set of rejection reasons named in the atom's Decision points.
- **I** — the invariant set. Each named invariant in the atom's Invariants section maps to a member of I. Invariants are not assertions run on every read; they are correctness conditions the compiler must prove T preserves. Two classes: *single-state invariants* (hold over the new state after each write — assertable as a post-write pure function) and *sequence-safety invariants* (hold over any history of states — the compiler must prove T never produces a violating state, not assert at runtime).
- **Q** — the query surface: the named read queries the SM exposes without triggering a transition. Maps to the atom's Outputs section (read surfaces only). Each query is a direct effect (DB read) followed by a pure projection. Q does not modify state.

Action return values — the `id` returned by `assign`, the `ok` returned by `confirm` — are a separate surface **R**: a pure projection function over `state_{t+1}` and the event, emitted as part of Step 4. R is not part of the SM tuple; it is generated from the atom's Outputs section (action return specifications).

**Key rule.** A state machine is the only construct permitted to mutate persistent state. All mutation happens inside T, expressed as a database write. Pure functions and queries never mutate state.

---

### Pure Function (PF)

A pure function takes typed inputs and returns typed outputs with no IO, no state mutation, and no side effects. Pure functions are deterministic: same input, same output, always. They are used for guard evaluation, input validation, description normalization (as in Personal Todo's description policy — NFC normalization, trim, length check), invariant assertion, and projection formatting. A pure function may not invoke a direct effect.

---

### Direct Effect (DE)

A direct effect is an explicit, observable IO operation: a database read, a database write, a clock read, an entropy read (for ID generation), or an external API call. Direct effects are never hidden inside pure functions or inside the SM definition. Every direct effect is named at its call site and appears in exactly one step of the pipeline.

---

## The execution pipeline

Every state machine transition executes this exact sequence. No deviations. No additional steps.

```
Step 1.  READ STATE          DE   state_t  = store.read(entity_id)
Step 2.  EVALUATE GUARDS     PF   clock_t  = clock.now()              (DE)
                                  result   = G(state_t, event, params, clock_t)
         if typed_failure:        return typed_failure(reason)   → caller
Step 3.  TRANSITION + WRITE  DE   if pass:
                                    id_t        = entropy.generate()   (DE, if needed)
                                    state_{t+1} = T(state_t, event, params, clock_t, id_t)
                                    store.write(state_{t+1})
Step 4.  PROJECT OUTPUT      PF   output = R(state_{t+1}, event)
                                  return output   → caller
```

**Clock and ID are injected, never called from within G or T.** The clock is read once per invocation — an explicit direct effect at the top of Step 2 — and the same `clock_t` is passed first to G and then to T; the entropy read is an explicit direct effect at the top of Step 3, before T runs. G and T receive `clock_t` (and T additionally `id_t`) as parameters; neither reads the clock or generates IDs internally. A G or T that calls `now()` or `uuid()` inside itself is non-deterministic — it cannot be given fixed inputs to produce a predictable output, which means it cannot be tested deterministically and cannot be treated as a compilation target. Injection discipline is what makes both functions deterministic in their inputs. The single shared reading also removes guard/stamp skew: the value a temporal guard validated is byte-identical to the value T stamps into the record. *(Placement revised 2026-07-12: this section previously read the clock at the top of Step 3, after guards — which left temporal guards, e.g. Approval Step's reject-future-timestamp and resolved-value ordering bounds, with no legitimate clock access, since a pure G may not invoke a direct effect. Surfaced by the 2026-07-12 scheduled rescan of Approval Step and Party Identity.)*

**ID generation is conditional.** `id_t` is generated only for transitions that create new records — `place_hold` in Provisional Commitment, `assign` in Assignment, `add` in Personal Todo. Transitions that mutate existing records (confirm, release, expire, recall, edit, complete) do not generate an id.

---

### Step 1 failure

If the store read fails, the pipeline aborts before Step 2. The guard never evaluates; no transition fires. The caller receives `state-unavailable`. This is an infrastructure failure, not a guard failure.

---

### Step 3 failure

If the store write fails after Step 2 returns pass, the pipeline aborts. The caller receives `storage-failure`. The state at `entity_id` is unchanged — `state_t` remains the durable state. This is a critical distinction from Step 1 failure: in Step 3, the guard already passed. A caller who retries on `storage-failure` must understand that the transition may have partially executed — and whether partial execution is recoverable depends on the atom. (In Permissions, a `storage-failure` on `revoke` means the grant remains Active; the caller must not assume it is revoked and must retry. This is documented in that atom's Decision points as a security-critical failure mode.)

---

### Multi-write atomicity

Some transitions write to two stores (reassign in Assignment: mark old assignment Transferred, create new Active assignment; cascade-recall in Shared Todo's delete_task: recall the active assignment, then delete the task). Both writes are part of a single Step 3. The atomicity contract: both writes commit or both are rolled back. A partial state — one write committed, the other not — violates the atom's or composition's invariants and must not be observable. The implementation provides the transactional boundary; the spec names the atomicity requirement explicitly in each affected atom's Decision points.

---

## Atom compilation rules

The Grace Commons atom spec maps to the execution model through a direct section-to-target mapping:

| Atom section | Compilation target |
|---|---|
| State (state names) | S — the named state set |
| State (transition descriptions) | T — transition function body (DB write per transition) |
| Inputs (action signatures) | E — typed event set per action |
| Inputs (rejection reasons in signatures) | Typed failure space of G |
| Decision points | G — guard function per event, evaluating over state_t and clock_t |
| Invariants (single-state) | Post-write PF assertions; compiler emits checks after store.write |
| Invariants (sequence-safety) | Compiler correctness obligations on T; runtime serialization guarantees |
| Outputs (read surfaces) | Q — named read queries; DE reads + PF projection |
| Outputs (action returns) | R — per-event return projection; PF over state_{t+1} |
| Description / validation rules | PF normalization functions, called inside G before guard evaluation |
| Identity model | id_t injection rule: generate once per creation event, inject into T |

**Invariant classes matter for code generation.** Single-state invariants (Invariant 8 timestamp ordering in Personal Todo, Invariant 2 event immutability in Event Log) compile to post-write assertions — pure functions the compiler emits immediately after `store.write` to check the new state satisfies the invariant before returning. Sequence-safety invariants (Invariant 1 membership exclusivity in Personal Todo, Invariant 7 reassign atomicity in Assignment) cannot be checked in isolation after a single write; the compiler must prove that no execution of T starting from a valid state can produce an invalid state, and the runtime must serialize transitions to prevent concurrent races from bypassing this guarantee.

---

### Section-name classification — the mapping tables are the SSOT

The two section-mapping tables in this document — the atom-section → compilation-target table above, and the spec-section → test-type table in the Testing model — together with the classification below are the **canonical record** of the correspondence between [`spec-format.md`](./spec-format.md)'s section names and the runtime. spec-format owns the containers (which sections exist, their order, their tiers — see its §Ownership seam with the Execution Contract); this document owns what those sections mean when lowered. The tables are keyed to spec-format's section names, which makes them the seam where the two documents can silently drift: a section renamed or added in spec-format with no entry here leaves the compiler's contract speaking about a container that no longer exists — the same failure class as a mirrored library-state count. The classification plus the lint check below make that drift mechanically catchable instead of reader-dependent.

**Every section name spec-format requires is classified exactly once** — either *compiling* (a mapping-table row or a named section of this document specifies its lowering) or *non-compiling* (its content is human-tier, scope-declaring, or evidence-bearing — consumed by readers and the methodology, not by the compiler):

- **Compiling — atom shape:** Identity model; Inputs and Outputs; State; Decision points; Invariants; Examples; description/validation rules within Inputs. (Rows in the two mapping tables.)
- **Compiling — composition shape:** Composes (lowers to the constituent interface bindings and the declared instance topology — see §Substrate composition invocation); Composition state (lowers per §Composition state — each derived index compiles to a rebuildable projection with its named rebuild procedure); Configuration (lowers to the deployment's named knob surface); Primitive policies (lowers to PF validation/normalization functions — the composition-boundary instance of the *Description / validation rules* row); Action wiring (lowers to the directed invocation graph plus one composition test per named action); Composition-level invariants (post-wiring assertions).
- **Compiling — regulated overlay:** Generation acceptance (named read queries); Regulated adversarial scenarios (acceptance tests).
- **Non-compiling (named):** Frontmatter; Title and summary blockquote; Intent; Summary; Flow, Behavior, and Feedback (narrative views of the state machine, of the transitions' observable consequences, and of the query surface — their load-bearing content compiles via the State, Outputs, and Decision points rows, and the Pass 1 reference graph is what guarantees the narrative and the compiled sections agree); Non-goals and edge cases (scope declarations naming composing patterns; they do not lower); The load-bearing wiring decision (defended prose for the human tier); Composition notes; Standards references; Status; Ledger; Decisions.

*Composition logic* (spec-format composition-shape item 5) is a **grouping header**, not a leaf section: it has no lowering of its own and is classified through its subsections — Composition state, Configuration, Primitive policies, and Action wiring (compiling, above) plus The load-bearing wiring decision (non-compiling, above). It is named here so that every required section name spec-format enumerates appears in the classification, per lint check (1) below.

**The section-name lint check (specified; sibling of the dangling-link check).** A linter pass in the same family as [`tools/linter/lint.py`](tools/linter/lint.py)'s dangling-link check and the planned dangling-capability check enforces the classification bidirectionally: (1) every required section name enumerated in spec-format's three shapes appears in the classification above, and (2) every name in the classification is still a section spec-format requires. A name failing (1) is an unclassified new or renamed section — this document has not decided what it means at runtime. A name failing (2) is a stale classification entry — this document speaks about a container that no longer exists. Either is a finding routed through the standard channel against the edit that broke the correspondence. Until the linter lands, the classification is enforced by review: any edit to spec-format's required-section lists, or to this classification, names the other document in the same change.

---

### Regulated atoms

Atoms carrying the regulated overlay, and any atom whose examples invoke regulated domains, compile with two additional outputs beyond the standard set:

**Generation acceptance checks.** Each check in the atom's Generation acceptance section compiles to a named read query over the record set — a SQL query an external auditor can run to verify the invariant holds without recourse to source code. These checks are first-class outputs of the compiler, not tests.

**Regulated adversarial scenario tests.** Each of the three canonical adversarial scenarios (regulator audit, disputed transaction or data-subject request, breach investigation) compiles to a named test that seeds the record set to a known state, runs the adversarial query, and asserts the expected result. These tests are executable specifications of the invariants the atom claims to provide to an external evaluator.

---

## Composition model

A composition is not a merged state machine. It is not a higher-order state machine with its own persistent state. It is a **stateless interpreter of a directed invocation graph over stateful atoms** — a function-level orchestration that sequences constituent SM transitions within the scope of a single action invocation. "Directed invocation graph" names what the composition structurally is: a graph of atom calls with explicit directed edges (sequential, conditional, or parallel — see Composition types below). The graph is a first-class compilation artifact, not prose description; the compiler reads the graph to emit the wiring code, not the other way around.

The distinction is load-bearing. A formalization that gives the composition its own state set S introduces a state artifact that has no atom spec, no identity model, no durability contract, and no invariants. The question "where does the composition's orchestration state live?" has no answer within the model — and that is the model's fault, not the implementor's. Grace Commons eliminates the question by construction: **compositions carry no persistent truth of their own beyond their constituents' stores.** What looks like "orchestration state" — the intermediate result of a constituent call, the branch taken, the flag set mid-sequence — is ephemeral local state within a single action invocation. It lives on the call stack. When the action returns, it is gone. One construct refines this rule without weakening it: a composition may carry a **derived index** — read-path state every fact of which is rebuildable from its constituents' stores — precisely because a rebuildable projection carries no truth of its own. The rule, its twin extraction rule, and the obligations they impose are in §Composition state below (adjudicated 2026-06-10).

If a composition needs to record that a multi-step sequence occurred — coordination history, execution progress, ordered event trace — it does so by composing Event Log. The history belongs to Event Log's store and is governed by Event Log's invariants. The composition does not grow a second record store to hold what an atom already owns.

---

### Composition state — the derived-index rule and the extraction rule

*(Adjudicated 2026-06-10, Refactor 1. This section is the single owner of composition-state semantics; [`spec-format.md`](./spec-format.md) §Composition state is the container that documents each element against it.)*

The corpus's composition specs carry a **Composition state** subsection (titled `Application state` until the 2026-06-11 vocabulary sweep migrates each heading) — binding maps, grant-pairing maps, attribution indexes — while the model above says a composition carries no persistent truth. Both are right, and the reconciliation is one question asked of every state element: **is every fact in this element fully derivable, at any time, from the constituents' stores through their declared read surfaces?**

**Derivable → derived index (permitted construct).** A derived index is read-path acceleration over constituent truth: a map or index every fact of which is reconstructible by a named rebuild procedure over constituent query surfaces. It is explicitly a cache, and it is permitted exactly because it carries no truth — which is why it does not reintroduce the state artifact the model forbids: no identity model, durability contract, or invariant surface is *needed* for state that can be regenerated from spec-governed stores at any time. Three obligations attach:

1. **Named derivation.** The spec names the constituent store(s) the index derives from and the rebuild procedure — the query enumeration that regenerates it from empty.
2. **Outside the atomicity surface.** The index is excluded from its action's multi-write atomicity obligation: its population is *evidence* that the truth-bearing writes committed, never a peer write whose failure the compensation protocol must handle. A missing or lost entry is a rebuild trigger, not data loss; a formal model of the action models the truth-bearing stores and omits the index.
3. **No consistency claim.** A derived index inherits the best-effort semantics of composition queries (see Boundary rules): it claims no cross-constituent transactional consistency. The moment a projection must be transactionally consistent with its sources — or readable under a guarantee a rebuild cannot honor — it is the materialized-projection *atom* of the Boundary rules, not an index.

The worked example of the derivable pole is Immutable Transaction Ledger's `disclosure_to_event`: the binding fact already lives in the substrate ledger's `ledger.disclosed` events (`data.disclosure_id`), and Immutable Transaction Ledger's own spec states that both orphan checks run by reading the substrate's Event Log without a separate index — the map is pure read-path acceleration over substrate truth.

**Non-derivable → extracted atom (the extraction rule).** Composition state that carries truth *not* reconstructible from constituent stores is a not-yet-extracted atom. The model's original objection stands undiluted for this case — an owned truth-bearing store has no atom spec, no identity model, no durability contract, no invariant surface — and the repair is to give it one by extraction, not to bless the omission. The worked example of the non-derivable pole is Idempotent Reservation's `token_results`: token → result is new truth (*which result was returned for this token*) that no replay of Provisional Commitment + Duplicate Prevention reproduces — Duplicate Prevention answers *have I seen this identity?* (membership, no payload), and its own spec states that the concept does not act on the result. The extraction this forces — an **Idempotency Result Memo** atom (token → result, single write, window-governed eviction) — is opened as a roadmap proposal (see [`roadmap.md`](./roadmap.md)); Duplicate Prevention + the Memo together complete idempotent-replay semantics, and the wiring layer thins back toward pure orchestration.

**Until an extraction lands, the exception is named, never normalized.** A composition carrying a non-derivable element declares it in Composition state as *extraction-pending*, naming the proposed atom. The flag is what keeps the debt visible: an unflagged truth-bearing composition store is a conformance finding; a flagged one is recorded debt riding the extraction's schedule. Extractions touch grounded patterns and their formal models, so they ride touch-triggered re-pass rounds — budgeted, not ad hoc.

This section resolves an inconsistency this document previously carried in three passages at once: the composition model's no-persistent-state rule, a wiring-layer example citing Idempotent Reservation's token-result cache approvingly, and a data-layer clause filing `token_results` under atoms with multiple stores while the A-stack section calls Idempotent Reservation the first composition. The rule above replaces all three readings: the cache is real, it is non-derivable, and it is therefore extraction-pending — not an atom's second store, and not a sanctioned composition store.

---

### What the wiring layer does

The wiring layer has three jobs:

1. **Defines the composition's action surface** — the named actions in Shared Todo (`add_task`, `assign_task`, etc.), the named actions in Idempotent Reservation (`place_hold`, `confirm`, etc.).
2. **Sequences constituent SM transitions in declared order** — `Permissions.permitted` before `PersonalTodo.add`, `DuplicatePrevention.check` before `ProvisionalCommitment.place_hold`.
3. **Enforces application-level invariants that no constituent atom can enforce alone** — cascade-on-delete in Shared Todo (Assignment.recall before PersonalTodo.delete), exactly-once-in-window in Idempotent Reservation (retries return the prior result — backed by `token_results`, the worked *extraction-pending* case of §Composition state above).

---

### Composition types

Three wiring patterns cover the full space of Grace Commons compositions:

**Sequential.** The output projection of atom A is used as input to atom B, which runs after A completes. `DuplicatePrevention.check → ProvisionalCommitment.place_hold` in Idempotent Reservation is sequential: the check must pass before the hold is attempted. Sequential composition does not introduce shared state; the intermediate result is a local value passed as an argument.

**Conditional.** A pure function over current constituent state selects which atom to call, or whether to call the next atom at all. `Permissions.permitted(actor, task, write)` in Shared Todo is a conditional gate: if G returns `typed_failure`, the composition aborts without touching Personal Todo. The branch selection is a pure function — no runtime ambiguity, no stored routing decision.

**Parallel.** Two or more atoms are called independently, with no output of one serving as input to the other. The composition's action surface may derive a joint projection from both results — a read query that joins constituent Q surfaces — but neither atom's transition depends on the other's. No shared state mediates the parallel calls. Parallel wiring is governed by the fan-out boundary rule below and worked in the [Notification Fanout](./compositions/notification-fanout.md) composition (Subscription × Notification); whichever wiring pattern a composition uses, the rule is the same: independence means no shared persistent state, only a joint projection.

---

### The atom interface contract

A composition interacts with each constituent atom through a fixed interface: **accept an event, receive a projection.** Nothing more.

```
AtomInterface = {
  accept(event, params) → output | typed_failure(reason)
  query(name, params)   → result_set
}
```

The composition does not read the constituent atom's internal state directly. It does not perform DB joins against the atom's table outside the atom's declared Q surface. It does not inspect the atom's state schema (S). It does not call T or G directly — those are invoked by the atom's own pipeline when `accept` is called. The interface is opaque by design: a composition that reaches past it is not wiring atoms, it is coupling to implementation details and will break when the atom changes. For constituents that are themselves compositions — substrates — the same interface discipline generalizes; see §Substrate composition invocation below.

**No cross-atom DB joins.** The prohibition follows from the interface contract. If two atoms' stores are joined outside their Q surfaces — a raw SQL join across their tables — the join logic is not governed by either atom's spec. It has no invariants, no guard semantics, no rejection reasons. When either atom's schema changes, the join breaks silently. Derived queries that need data from two atoms compose their Q surfaces in a pure function: `join(AtomA.query(name), AtomB.query(name))`. The pure join function has no IO; the two Q calls are the direct effects.

---

### The pipeline applies to composition actions

A composition action that sequences two constituent SM transitions still executes the full four-step pipeline at the composition level — with Step 3 containing the sequenced constituent calls and the multi-write atomicity obligation applying across constituent store boundaries. The wiring layer is itself subject to the pipeline; it is not an exception to it.

Derived queries (`responsible_actor`, `visible_tasks` in Shared Todo) are pure joins over constituent Q surfaces — direct effects (reads from constituent stores) followed by a pure join function. The composition does not own a separate record store; it derives.

---

### Substrate composition invocation

*(Added 2026-06-10, Refactor 1.)* A composition may name another composition as a constituent — a **substrate** — rather than re-listing the substrate's own constituents. [`spec-format.md`](./spec-format.md) §Compositions of compositions owns the container convention (how the Composes section names a substrate); this section owns what the naming means at runtime. Without it the contract is silently incomplete one level up: the atom interface contract and the conformance definition speak only of constituent *atoms*, while the corpus composes compositions — Defensible Retention names Audit Trail; Resolve a Person's Data Rights names Defensible Retention, whose own substrate is Audit Trail; Privileged Access Provisioning names Multi-Party Approval and Audit Trail at once.

**The interface generalizes; opacity is preserved.** A substrate is invoked through exactly the surface its own spec declares — its named composition actions and its read surface:

```
CompositionInterface = {
  invoke(action, params) → output | typed_failure(reason)
  query(name, params)    → result_set
}
```

This is the atom interface contract one level up, and every opacity clause carries over: the composing layer does not read the substrate's constituent stores directly, does not join against them outside declared read surfaces, and does not re-derive or police the substrate's internal wiring. The substrate's rejection taxonomy is whatever its action signatures declare; each rejection is mapped — **propagated** (passed through unchanged) or **renamed** (re-coded at the boundary, including surfaced under a new composition-level code) — exactly as a constituent atom's rejections are. A constituent rejection that determines an action's outcome always *surfaces* at the boundary under one of those two forms; it is never silently absorbed. (Idempotent replay returns a cached outcome by *not re-invoking* the constituent — a query branch on a duplicate-token check, as in Idempotent Reservation — not by swallowing a rejection the constituent raised.) This is the canonical rejection-mapping rule for every composition, atom-constituent or substrate; spec-format's *Action wiring* container enumerates the taxonomy and defers here for what the mapping means.

**Pipelines nest whole; they do not flatten.** A substrate action invoked in a composing action's Step 3 executes its own complete four-step pipeline — read, guard, transition-plus-write, project — inside the invocation, exactly as it would standalone. The pipeline-applies rule is invocation-scoped, not call-depth-scoped: one pipeline per action invocation, each complete, at every depth. The composing action's Step 2 guards evaluate only the composing layer's own preconditions; the substrate's guards run inside the substrate's pipeline when it is invoked, and a substrate guard failure surfaces to the composing layer as the invocation's typed failure *during Step 3* — a constituent rejection mid-sequence, handled by the composing action's declared failure path, never retroactively reclassified as a composing-layer Step 2 outcome.

**Atomicity layers; it does not flatten.** Each layer owns the atomicity of exactly the write sequence *it* sequences. A substrate action that is internally multi-store (Audit Trail's `record_action` commits an event append, an attestation, a retention record, and seal coverage) discharges its own multi-write atomicity obligation inside its own Step 3. The composing layer treats the invocation as **one atomic constituent call, modulo the substrate's declared partial-failure surface** — it inherits the substrate's recovery discipline by reference and never re-derives it (Multi-Party Approval's audit-completeness invariant holding *modulo* Audit Trail's partial-attestation edge case is the worked form). The composing layer's own multi-write obligation spans its own sequence. Where every write in that sequence — including the substrate invocation's — is a recoverable store write, the implementation may discharge an all-or-nothing claim by providing a transactional boundary enclosing the whole composing Step 3 (the multi-write atomicity contract's rule: the spec names the obligation, each target supplies the mechanism; Actor Suspension's all-or-nothing multi-surface revocation is the worked form). Where an irreversible write — constituent or substrate — precedes further writes in the sequence, all-or-nothing rollback is unavailable by construction, and the composing spec must name the resulting orphan state and its compensation in a *Cross-store consistency under partial failure* edge case (sequential-with-compensation; Immutable Transaction Ledger's `disclose_subset` is the worked form). Two flattening reads are forbidden: claiming the composing action is atomic *because* the substrate's action is, and requiring rollback across a write the constituent's own spec declares irreversible.

**Instance topology is declared; instance unity is the default.** Reaching a substrate's constituents "transitively" means: exactly one instance of each transitively-reached constituent exists at the composition — the one the substrate carries — and the composing layer never maintains an undeclared duplicate. Two consequences, both load-bearing in the corpus:

1. **Declared direct invocation of a substrate constituent is permitted.** A composing layer may call a substrate constituent's own declared action directly on the instance the substrate carries — Multi-Party Approval and Resolve a Person's Data Rights record their own events by calling `AuditTrail.record_action` on the Audit Trail their substrate carries — when three conditions hold: the capability is the constituent's *own declared* action or query (capability provenance — never an ambient "the substrate can…"); the instance is the substrate's (no second instance, no bypass copy); and the path is named in the Composes section (the reach is declared topology, not discovered plumbing). This is the established substrate-composition pattern, it is layer-count-agnostic (Resolve a Person's Data Rights reaches Audit Trail through Defensible Retention, two layers down), and it licenses invoking declared *surfaces* only — never reading stores.
2. **Deliberate multi-instance topologies are declared as such.** Where the same atom legitimately appears twice — a business-record Retention Window distinct from the audit-event Retention Window inside an Audit Trail substrate (Defensible Retention, Customer Onboarding) — the spec declares both instances and their distinct policies explicitly. Undeclared instance duplication is a conformance failure; declared distinct instances are correct topology. A composition naming two substrates that share a constituent declares whether the instances coincide (Privileged Access Provisioning: one Audit Trail instance serving both its own events and its Multi-Party Approval substrate's chain events).

**Transitive reads go through declared read surfaces.** A composing layer may read transitively-reached state only through the substrate's declared read surface, or through a reached constituent's declared queries on the substrate's instance per the direct-invocation rule — Immutable Transaction Ledger validates disclosed-subset membership by reading the substrate's Event Log filtered by `action_ref`, passed through Audit Trail's read surface. A raw join against a substrate constituent's tables is the cross-atom DB join prohibition operating one level up, and fails the same way: ungoverned by any spec, silently broken by any schema change.

**Mechanism capability invocation is the named residual.** One invocation class fits neither an action call nor a query: a composition-introduced surface that consumes a *deployment-declared mechanism capability* of a constituent. Immutable Transaction Ledger's `verification_bundle` construction invokes the configured Tamper Evidence mechanism's inclusion-proof capability — declared by the deployment as a named configuration capability — because no constituent action produced a subset proof when the surface was introduced. This is permitted under exactly the capability-provenance discipline ([`pressure-testing.md`](./pressure-testing.md) §Capability provenance): the capability is declared (a named deployment obligation, verified by an externally-clearable check), the consuming surface is composition-introduced and specified at the composition layer, and the invocation is logic-confinement-clean — the mechanism is configured material invoked at a named step, never crypto or IO improvised inside core logic. The honest residual is also named: a recurring mechanism-capability surface is a not-yet-extracted-atom signal (Immutable Transaction Ledger's names the forthcoming Subset Proof atom as its retirement path), so this construct is a bridge with a named exit, not a permanent third interface.

**Conformance extends recursively.** A composition is conforming when all of its constituents — atoms *and* substrate compositions, recursively — are conforming and its application-level invariants hold over the joint record set its wiring produces. A substrate's non-conformance is inherited: no composing layer is conforming over a non-conforming substrate. And no composing layer is obligated to re-verify what the substrate's own conformance already establishes — inheriting a guarantee by reference is the point of naming a substrate.

---

### Boundary rules

These are the hard limits where the composition model either holds or silently reintroduces hidden machinery. All four are variants of the same pressure: coordination complexity trying to migrate into the composition layer. The composition layer must not absorb it.

**Fan-out is a decomposition boundary, not a transition.** No atom produces non-atomic fan-out side effects. An action that triggers delivery to N recipients is not a single transition — it is two responsibilities that belong to two atoms: recording the intent (one write, fully atomic, one atom) and executing per-recipient delivery (N independent state machines, one per recipient, each retryable independently). Fan-out that is modeled as a single transition with N side effects has introduced partial-write ambiguity — some recipients receive, others do not, and the atom's consistency domain is undefined. The correct decomposition: Intent atom records the trigger; Fanout composition creates N Delivery Task atoms from the intent; each Delivery Task atom owns its own state, retry, and failure. This is the [Notification Fanout](./compositions/notification-fanout.md) pattern.

**Parallel composition carries no rollback guarantee.** If A succeeds and B fails in a parallel composition, A's write stands. The composition does not roll back A. If the system requires A to be undone when B fails — if atomicity across parallel branches is a correctness requirement — that is not a composition problem. It is a new atom: a compensating state machine that must be explicitly defined, with its own states (Pending, Compensated, Unrecoverable), its own guard logic, and its own invariants. The composition invokes it. If rollback is needed, you are defining a new atom, not composing.

**Atoms may carry opaque references to entities they do not own.** An Approval Step carries a `target_id` for the thing awaiting approval; it does not own that thing's state machine. The invariant rule: an atom's correctness conditions may never depend on the continued existence of the referenced entity. A dangling reference — a `target_id` whose target has been deleted — must produce a typed guard failure (`target-not-found` or equivalent), not an invariant violation. The decision state machine remains in a valid state regardless of whether its target still exists. This separates the lifecycle of the decision from the lifecycle of the thing decided about, which is the correct boundary: Approval Step owns the state of a decision about a reference, not the state of the referenced thing.

**Composition queries are best-effort projections over independent consistency domains.** No cross-atom transactional read guarantee exists or can be provided without reintroducing a hidden consistency layer. A join across two constituent Q surfaces is two sequential direct-effect reads; between those reads, another writer may commit a transition to either store. This is not a defect — it is the correct behavior of a system where each atom owns its own consistency boundary. If the system requires consistent cross-atom reads — a query surface that must reflect all in-flight writes atomically — that derived state becomes its own atom: its own store, its own state machine, its own invariants. A materialized projection atom is a first-class atom, not a cache. A cache's consistency depends on invalidation strategy; an atom's correctness holds by invariant.

**The meta-rule.** Anything that requires coordination, consistency, fan-out, or lifecycle guarantees is not the composition's job. It is either an atom or a decomposition into multiple atoms. Composition is not a system of control. It is a system of invocation.

---

### Three-way taxonomy

The model has exactly three kinds of runtime entity. No fourth kind is permitted.

| Entity | Kind | Owns state? | Owns history? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Atom** | Persistent state machine | Yes — its own store | Only its own record set |
| **Composition** | Stateless orchestration function | No — call-stack only | No |
| **Event Log** | Atom (temporal) | Yes — its own store | Yes — the only legitimate history store |

If a composition seems to need persistent state, the answer is not to give the composition a store — it is to compose Event Log. The composition's "memory" of what happened is the Event Log's record set, governed by Event Log's invariants and Q surface. The composition remains stateless; the history remains auditable and spec-governed.

A derived index (§Composition state) is not a fourth kind: it is a rebuildable projection of constituent stores — the same ontological status as any derived artifact — and owns neither state nor history in the table's sense. The taxonomy governs truth-bearing runtime entities; anything truth-bearing is one of the three.

---

## UI projection contract

```
UI = render(Q(state))
```

The UI is a pure function of projected state. Q is the query surface — the named read queries that execute as direct effects and return typed result sets. `render` is a pure function from typed result sets to UI elements. In A-stack, `render` is a JSX component function: `(result: ProjectionResult) => JSX.Element`.

Rules:
- UI components have no direct store access. All data arrives through Q.
- UI components have no local state that is not derivable from Q. Hidden component state is a violation of the contract.
- Subscriptions, reactive bindings, and implicit update triggers are not permitted. When state changes (after a successful Step 3), Q is re-invoked and render is called with the new result. The mechanism that re-invokes Q is explicit and named — it is not a framework lifecycle.
- A UI component that caches a result and displays stale state after a transition has violated the contract.

---

## Data layer contract

The schema is derived from the SM definition. Specifically:
- One table per atom (or per distinct record type where an atom's spec names multiple stores). A composition-carried derived index (§Composition state) may compile to a table, but a rebuildable one — droppable and regenerated from constituent stores by its named rebuild procedure, never migrated as truth. A composition-carried table that *cannot* be regenerated that way is the schema-level symptom of a not-yet-extracted atom (Idempotent Reservation's `token_results` is the worked case — *extraction-pending* per §Composition state).
- One column per field named in the atom's State section.
- One enum (or constrained varchar) per S for the status column.
- Timestamp columns are nullable where the atom's spec says the field is absent until a specific transition.
- No column exists in the schema that does not correspond to a field named in the atom's spec.

**Permitted tooling.** Explicit parameterized SQL; a query builder that compiles to visible, predictable SQL (Drizzle in query-builder mode). Schema declarations (table and column definitions). Explicit migration scripts.

**Not permitted.** ORM relations that trigger implicit joins or lazy loading. Active Record patterns that embed guard or projection logic in model objects. Any tool that generates SQL at runtime through reflection, magic method dispatch, or relationship traversal.

The `next_sequence_number` counter in Event Log requires atomic increment-and-append semantics — the counter increment and the event record write are a single Step 3 operation committed atomically. This is not two writes; it is a database operation that atomically increments the counter and inserts the row in one transaction.

That atomicity, and the total order it protects (Event Log Invariant 3; the operational clause *"appends never fail for ordering or contention reasons — the underlying implementation must serialize them"*), is a **runtime serialization guarantee**, not portable code. The contract names the obligation; each target supplies the mechanism. Observed across four reference renders of the same Event Log spec: SQLite's single-writer lock (the storage engine provides it for free), PostgreSQL's `pg_advisory_xact_lock` held for the transaction body, a Go process's `sync.Mutex`, and MongoDB's replica-set transaction with the unique chain-position index as fork guard and optimistic retry absorbing the conflict. One invariant, four mechanisms — a worked instance of the general rule that the runtime owns serialization while the spec owns the invariant. The mechanism is the non-portable seam; the clause it satisfies is canonical. (Renders: `demos/clinical-trial-portal`, `-next`, `-go`, `-mongo`; findings logged in `discoveries.md`, 2026-06-06 and 2026-06-07.)

---

## Error model

Three failure classes. No others.

**Guard failure.** G returns `typed_failure(reason)` in Step 2. The reason is one of the named rejection reasons in the atom's Decision points. The store is unchanged. The caller receives the typed rejection. Guard failures are the normal operational outcome of preconditions not being met — they are not error conditions and must not be logged as errors. Every named rejection reason must be reachable by a conforming caller in a well-specified scenario.

**Effect failure.** The store read fails (Step 1) or the store write fails (Step 3). These are infrastructure failures.
- Step 1: the caller receives `state-unavailable`. No guard ran. No transition fired. Retry is safe.
- Step 3: the caller receives `storage-failure`. The guard passed. The store write failed. The state is unchanged. Retry may be safe depending on the atom — but the caller must not assume the transition did not fire. Where partial execution is security-critical (Permissions `revoke`), the atom's spec says so explicitly.

**Invariant violation.** An illegal state is produced that violates a member of I. This condition has three causes: a compiler bug (T was generated incorrectly), a spec violation (T was implemented in deviation from the spec), or a serialization failure (two concurrent transitions both passed their guards against the same `state_t` before either write committed). None of these is a recoverable caller error. The implementation must surface this as a fatal condition for investigation, not as a typed rejection the caller handles.

---

## Testing model

Testing in Grace Commons is not a separate layer. It is a second view over the same state machine semantics — state machine replays with assertions over projection functions, compiled from the spec rather than authored independently. The Examples section of every atom is already a test specification; the Regulated adversarial scenarios are already acceptance tests; the Decision points are already guard test specifications. The compiler emits the test suite; there is no test authoring step.

**The core rule.** Every test is a declared traversal of the state machine graph. Not unit tests, integration tests, or mocks as separate concepts — just state transitions and assertions over projections. Same pipeline. Different inputs.

---

### Test types

**Guard test.** Exercises G directly — no store, no pipeline, no IO. Inputs: a known `state_t`, event parameters, and a fixed `clock_t`. Execution: call `G(state_t, event, params, clock_t)` as a pure function. Temporal guards (future-timestamp bounds, ordering checks against stored timestamps) are exercised by varying the fixed `clock_t`; the test stays deterministic because the clock is an input, not a read. Assertion: result is the expected `pass` or `typed_failure(reason)`. One guard test per named rejection reason in the atom's Decision points, plus one for the pass case per transition. These are the fastest tests in the suite and the ones that cover the entire guard logic surface in isolation.

**Transition test.** Runs the full four-step pipeline against a real store seeded to a known state. Inputs: seed data in store (derived from the atom's Examples section) + event + params. Execution: full pipeline (Read → Guard → Transition+Write → Project). Assertions: (a) R returns the expected output; (b) Q returns results consistent with the new state; (c) single-state invariants hold over `state_{t+1}`. One transition test per named transition in the atom's State section, covering both the happy path and each guard-failure path.

**Sequence test.** Runs multiple pipeline steps in sequence from a known starting state. Inputs: starting state in store + ordered event sequence. Execution: N pipeline runs, one per event. Assertions: (a) intermediate states match expected; (b) final state matches expected; (c) sequence-safety invariants hold over the full history. Compiles from the atom's Examples (walkthrough scenarios) and from the sequence-safety invariant class. The rejection-path example in Personal Todo (eight events, five rejection reasons, one sequence) is a sequence test.

**Composition test.** Runs a composition action — which sequences constituent SM transitions through the wiring layer — against all constituent stores seeded to a known joint state. Assertions: (a) all constituent stores are in the expected state after the action; (b) application-level invariants hold over the joint record set. Compiles from the composition's action wiring and application-level invariants. One composition test per named composition action, plus tests for cascade behaviors (cascade-on-delete in Shared Todo, storage-failure cascade-abort).

**Acceptance test (regulated atoms only).** Seeds the record set to a state matching a regulated adversarial scenario, runs the Generation acceptance checks as read queries, and asserts the expected results. Compiles from the Generation acceptance section (the check queries) and the Regulated adversarial scenarios (the seed data and expected outcomes). These tests are the machine-executable form of "what an external auditor can verify from the records alone."

---

### The seeding rule — not mocking

Tests that need a store do not use mocks. They use a real in-memory store (or a test transaction rolled back after each test) seeded with concrete data derived from the atom's Examples section. The distinction matters: mocks replace a dependency with a fake implementation and introduce divergence between what the test exercises and what production executes. Seeding populates the real implementation — the same store, the same SQL, the same schema — with known state before the test runs. If a transition test passes against a seeded in-memory store, it will pass against a production store given identical initial state. This is the determinism guarantee; mocking destroys it.

The seed data is not authored separately. It is derived from the atom's Examples section — the concrete values the spec already provides. Personal Todo's rejection-path example seeds: one unit in Pending with description "buy milk." The test sequence follows the example exactly. If the spec changes the example, the seed data changes with it; there is no diverging test fixture to maintain.

---

### Spec section to test type mapping

| Spec section | Test type compiled |
|---|---|
| Decision points (each rejection reason) | Guard test — one per named reason, plus pass case |
| State (transitions, happy path) | Transition test — one per named transition |
| Invariants (single-state class) | Post-write assertions within each Transition test |
| Invariants (sequence-safety class) | Sequence tests targeting each invariant's boundary conditions |
| Examples (happy-path scenarios) | Seed data + expected outcomes for Transition and Sequence tests |
| Examples (rejection-path scenarios) | Seed data + expected guard-failure outcomes |
| Composition wiring (each action) | Composition test — one per named composition action |
| Composition-level invariants | Post-wiring assertions within each Composition test |
| Generation acceptance (regulated) | Acceptance test check queries |
| Regulated adversarial scenarios | Acceptance test seed data + expected query results |

Every row in the table is a compilation rule. No test is authored that does not correspond to a row. No spec section exists that does not compile to at least one test type. The test suite is a complete projection of the spec — and if the spec is complete (all three pressure-testing passes clean), the test suite is complete by construction.

---

### What this removes

There is no separate testing infrastructure. There is no mocking framework. There is no test-doubles ontology. There is no CI configuration that encodes test semantics not present in the spec. The test runner executes the same pipeline the production runtime executes. The only difference between a test run and a production run is the store — in-memory and seeded vs. durable and production.

There is also no divergence path. A test cannot encode behavior the spec does not declare, because the test is compiled from the spec. A spec change propagates to the test suite at compile time, not at the next test-authoring session. The spec is the single source of truth for both production behavior and test expectations.

---

## Conformance

A runtime implementation of a Grace Commons atom is conforming when all of the following hold:

1. Every transition executes the four-step pipeline in order (Read → Guard → Transition+Write → Project) with no additional steps and no reordering.
2. `clock_t` is read as a direct effect at the top of Step 2 and injected into both G and T as a parameter; `id_t` is read as a direct effect at Step 3 and injected into T. Neither G nor T calls the clock or entropy source internally.
3. No persistent state mutation occurs outside Step 3's `store.write`.
4. Every rejection reason named in the atom's Decision points is reachable and typed. No rejection reason exists that is not named in the spec.
5. Every named invariant in I holds over the record set after any valid sequence of transitions, including sequences interleaved by other conforming callers under the implementation's serialization guarantees.
6. Q returns results consistent with the record set produced by the state machine's transition history. A query that disagrees with the durable record set is a conformance failure.
7. For regulated atoms: the Generation acceptance checks pass against the record set produced by any conforming run.

A composition is conforming when all of its constituents — atoms and substrate compositions, recursively (§Substrate composition invocation) — are conforming and the application-level invariants hold over the joint record set produced by the wiring layer.

The A-stack reference implementation is a conforming implementation. It is not the only conforming implementation. Any runtime that satisfies these seven conditions against the Grace Commons atom specs is conforming, regardless of language, database, or UI technology.

---

## A-stack reference implementation

A-stack is the reference runtime. It is the minimal conforming implementation — the smallest stack that exercises the full contract against real atoms without introducing abstractions the contract does not require.

| Layer | Technology | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime | Deno | Permission-explicit; TypeScript-first; no build ceremony |
| UI | JSX → pure functions | `(props: ProjectionResult) => JSX.Element`; no framework lifecycle |
| Data | PostgreSQL | Explicit parameterized SQL or Drizzle query-builder mode only |
| State machines | TypeScript discriminated unions | One union type per S; one typed function per event in E |
| Pipeline | Explicit per-transition | Steps 1–4 written out explicitly; no framework interpolates them |

The first two A-stack examples, in dependency order: **Personal Todo** (simplest atom — four actions, no regulated sections, covers the full pipeline with the description policy as a PF normalization example) and **Idempotent Reservation** (first composition — demonstrates multi-write atomicity in `place_hold`, the exactly-once emergent invariant, and the *extraction-pending* `token_results` store that §Composition state classifies).

---

*The Execution Contract is a methodology document. It is subject to the same three-pass review as any Grace Commons pattern: structural completeness (all nine MUSE nodes have a corresponding contract clause), conceptual independence (no primitive absorbs another primitive's responsibility), and adversarial scrutiny (no hidden runtime behavior exists that the contract does not name). The contract itself is pressure-testable. If a conforming implementation exhibits behavior this document does not predict, that is a Pass 3 finding against the contract.*
