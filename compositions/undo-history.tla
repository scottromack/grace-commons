\* WHAT THIS MODEL CHECKS (Tier-A + Tier-B extension, 2026-06-14)
\* The original model checked only undo-targeting (Inv 3) over an integer
\* abstraction. This model models the actual event-sourcing mechanism — a real
\* Personal Todo status per id plus a from-scratch replay derived from the log —
\* and machine-checks the load-bearing claims a skeptic wants:
\*   Inv1 (log faithfulness): no exposed-state change without a corresponding
\*       append; every successful action appends exactly one event. Modeled with
\*       an explicit storage-failure branch (the append can fail) and a ghost
\*       record of what each step did. (Falsified by the storage-failure twin,
\*       which updates derived even when the append failed.)
\*   Inv2 (state equivalence): the incrementally-maintained `derived` state equals
\*       replaying the non-undone events from scratch. The forward wiring updates
\*       `derived` incrementally; StatusOf recomputes it independently from the
\*       log; the check is that the two never diverge. (Falsified by the stale-undo
\*       twin, whose undo fails to recompute derived.)
\*   Inv3 (undo targeting): undo removes the most-recent non-undone forward event,
\*       so the undone set is a top-suffix of the forward log. (Falsified by the
\*       oldest-targeting twin.)
\*   Inv4 (replay validity / Personal Todo invariants preserved): replay never
\*       applies an event whose Personal Todo precondition fails — add only on an
\*       absent id, complete only on a pending id, delete only on a present id.
\*       (Also falsified by the oldest-targeting twin: removing a middle event
\*       leaves a later event with a failed precondition on replay.)
\*
\* ENCODING (mirrors the proven idiom in atoms/party-identity.tla)
\* - The forward log is an insertion-ordered pair of functions ltype/lid over
\*   1..MaxEvents with `len` filled slots (the Sequences module is avoided — the
\*   WASM checker handles Naturals/FiniteSets/functions; see tools/harness). Events
\*   are forward only (add/complete/delete); `undone[i]` marks forward event i
\*   undone — undo via a compensating marker, not mutation (Invariant 5).
\* - The derived-property operators are PURE FUNCTIONS OF THEIR ARGUMENTS: the log
\*   (lt/li), length, and undone-set are passed in, never read as free state
\*   variables. "Most-recent non-undone forward event for id x" is expressed with a
\*   flat \E .. \A predicate (IsLastFwd), no CHOOSE — exactly party-identity.tla's
\*   HasPassedAfterSuspend shape. (The earlier draft read ltype/lid as free vars
\*   inside CHOOSE-bearing operators and overflowed the WASM checker's stack at
\*   minimal scale; this encoding is the fix.)
\* - `derived` is the exposed Personal Todo status the wiring maintains; StatusOf
\*   computes the same status declaratively from (log, undone) as the effect of the
\*   most-recent non-undone forward event per id. `derived = StatusOf` is an honest
\*   equivalence between two independent computations, not a tautology — the
\*   stale-undo twin makes them diverge.
\* - SCOPE: forward-then-undo (no forward action after an undo — Invariant 7's
\*   redo-unreachability is out of scope, as in the prior model). `edit` events are
\*   omitted (a description-only change that does not affect the Pending/Done
\*   lifecycle the replay/identity claims turn on).
\*
\* NOT MODELED: identity preservation across delete/undo at field level (Invariant
\* 6 — id/timestamp content; this model tracks status, not content; Tier C). Event
\* Log's own invariants (Invariant 5; see atoms/event-log surface).

\* --- the verification surface ---

\* Invariant 1 — Log faithfulness. No exposed-state change without an append: a
\* step that changed the projection must have appended an event. The storage-failure
\* branches set didChange = didAppend = FALSE; every successful action sets both
\* TRUE; so didChange => didAppend is the action<->append coupling, and the
\* storage-failure twin (which changes derived on a failed append) violates it.
Inv1_LogFaithfulness == didChange => didAppend

\* Invariant 2 — State equivalence: maintained state equals replay of non-undone
\* events. The forward wiring maintains `derived` incrementally; StatusOf is the
\* independent from-scratch replay; this asserts they never diverge.
Inv2_StateEquivalence ==
    \A x \in Ids : derived[x] = StatusOf(ltype, lid, len, undone, x)

\* Invariant 3 — undo targets the most recent forward event: the undone set is a
\* top-suffix of the forward log.
Inv3_TopSuffix ==
    \A i, j \in 1..len : (i < j /\ undone[i]) => undone[j]

\* Invariant 4 — replay never applies an event whose Personal Todo precondition
\* fails (Personal Todo's invariants preserved over the derived state): each
\* non-undone forward event's precondition holds against the replay of 1..i-1.
Inv4_ReplayValid ==
    \A i \in 1..len :
        ~undone[i] =>
            (IF   ltype[i] = "add"
