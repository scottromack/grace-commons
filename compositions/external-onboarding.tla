---- MODULE external-onboarding ----
\* Grace Commons — External Onboarding composition.
\* Spec-level formal sibling of compositions/external-onboarding.md.
\* Grounded on Final Critique 4.
\*
\* This TLA+ model verifies the five application-level invariants from the
\* spec under every reachable state interleaving at the chosen bounds. It
\* is a peer artifact to the canonical English spec; if the spec changes,
\* this model should be updated to match.
\*
\* -------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* WHY TLA+ FOR THIS SPEC
\*
\* The spec's most consequential temporal claim is the single-resolution
\* gate: Invitation.accept is the serialization point. Under concurrent
\* onboard calls for the same invitation token, exactly one call succeeds;
\* all others receive already-resolved(Accepted) and create no permanent
\* records. TLA+ enumerates all possible interleavings of concurrent
\* Onboard steps; TLC will confirm that the precondition
\* `invitations[inv].status = "pending"` is sufficient to guarantee this
\* across every ordering.
\*
\* The companion Alloy model (if written) would carry the static structural
\* facts. This TLA+ model carries the temporal safety properties over the
\* operational state machine.
\*
\* -------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* SCOPE — INTENTIONAL EXCLUSIONS
\*
\* * Party Identity verification (Unverified → Verified). That transition
\*   belongs to Customer Onboarding and is outside this
\*   composition's surface.
\* * Credential rotation after onboarding. Outside the composition.
\* * Background invitation expiry scheduling. Expire is modeled as an
\*   action available to TLC but the composition does not own its trigger.
\* * Partial-failure recovery paths (admin intervention after interrupted
\*   onboarding). Modeled only enough to check Invariant 4 (audit coverage
\*   for the interrupted event); recovery is outside scope.
\* * The Audit Trail's own tamper-evidence properties. The Audit Trail
\*   substrate is represented as five sets tracking which events have been
\*   written; its internal hash chain is the Audit Trail composition's
\*   concern.
\*
\* -------------------------------------------------------------------------
\* COMPLEMENTARITY NOTE
\*
\* The `invite` action writes the Audit Trail record before calling
\* Invitation.initiate (audit-first discipline, spec section onboard notes step
\* ordering). In this model, both writes are atomic at the action grain
\* (TLA+ actions are atomic). The partial-failure case — Audit Trail record
\* exists but Invitation.initiate fails — is represented by the absence of
\* any invite-initiated record in invitations while an audit_initiated event
\* exists. That gap is what Generation Acceptance check 6 detects in a
\* running system; here it is noted as a known scope limitation.

\* =========================================================================
\* RECORD TYPES
\*
\* InvRec tracks the invitation's status and, on a successful onboard, the
\* party_id and cred_id that were created. These two fields are NULL for
\* invitations that are pending, declined, revoked, expired, or interrupted
\* (accepted but enrollment failed). They are non-NULL only when a full
\* successful Onboard has completed — which is exactly Invariant 5's
\* completeness condition.
\*
\* inviter_ref is omitted from InvRec. The inviting actor's identity is
\* needed for audit attribution; for invariant checking here, it is not
\* load-bearing.
\* =========================================================================

InvRec ==
    [ status   : InvStatuses,
      party_id : PartyIds   \cup {NULL},
      cred_id  : CredentialIds \cup {NULL} ]

\* PartyRec binds the enrolled party to the invitation that authorized its
\* creation (from_inv) and records when it was enrolled (for ordering check).
PartyRec ==
    [ enrolled_at : 0..MaxClock,
      from_inv    : InvitationIds ]

\* CredRec binds the credential to its subject (principal_ref = party_id)
\* and the invitation that authorized its creation.
CredRec ==
    [ principal_ref : PartyIds,
      registered_at : 0..MaxClock,
      from_inv      : InvitationIds ]

\* =========================================================================
\* VARIABLES

\* Domain state:

\*   parties      — the Party Identity store (PartyIds -> PartyRec | NULL)
\*   credentials  — the Credential store (CredentialIds -> CredRec | NULL)
\*
\* Audit Trail state (simplified — sets of invitation IDs per event type):
\*   audit_accepted    — invitations whose onboarding.invitation-accepted
\*                       event has been written (Invariant 4a)
\*   audit_declined    — invitations whose invitation.declined event has
\*                       been written (Invariant 4b)
\*   audit_revoked     — invitations whose invitation.revoked event has
\*                       been written (Invariant 4c)
\*   audit_interrupted — invitations whose onboarding.interrupted event has
\*                       been written (GA check 5 detection surface)

\* ACTIONS
\* =========================================================================

\* --- Invite(actor, inv) ---------------------------------------------------
\*
\* Models the spec's `invite` action (section Actions → invite).
\* Writes the Audit Trail initiation record and creates the Invitation in
\* Pending state. Both writes are atomic here (TLA+ action grain), matching
\* the spec's same-transactional-boundary requirement.
\*
\* Audit-first note: the spec calls Audit Trail.record_action before
\* Invitation.initiate. In the TLA+ model this ordering is collapsed into
\* one atomic step. The partial-failure case (audit record exists but
\* invitation creation failed) is noted in the file header as a known scope
\* exclusion; GA check 6 surfaces it in a running system.

\* --- Onboard(inv, party, cred, actor) ------------------------------------
\*
\* Models the spec's `onboard` action happy path (section Actions → onboard,
\* steps 3–8). The single-resolution gate fires first: the precondition
\* `invitations[inv].status = "pending"` is the atomic check corresponding
\* to Invitation.accept. Exactly one concurrent Onboard per invitation
\* can satisfy this precondition — the first to execute sets status to
\* "accepted"; all subsequent calls find status /= "pending" and are
\* disabled, creating no permanent records.
\*
\* All writes are atomic at this action grain:
\*   - Invitation status → "accepted" with party_id and cred_id filled in
\*   - Party Identity record created
\*   - Credential record created (principal_ref = party_id)
\*   - onboarding.invitation-accepted event written to audit_accepted
\*
\* The onboarding.completed event is represented by the presence of
\* non-NULL party_id and cred_id on the invitation record, which is
\* the condition Invariant 5 checks.

\* --- OnboardInterrupted(inv, actor) ---------------------------------------
\*
\* Models partial failure after Invitation.accept (spec section onboard, steps
\* 5–7 failure paths and section Edge cases → "Partial failure after
\* Invitation.accept"). The gate clears (invitation → Accepted) but the
\* downstream enrollment or credential registration fails.
\*
\* Invariant 1 (invitation gates enrollment) still holds: the invitation
\* is Accepted but no Party Identity record exists for it.
\* Invariant 4a (audit coverage for Accepted invitations) still holds:
\* the onboarding.invitation-accepted event is written.
\* The onboarding.interrupted event is written to audit_interrupted for
\* GA check 5 (unresolved interruptions detectable).

\* --- Decline(inv, actor) --------------------------------------------------

\* Per spec section Round 3 Pass 3 finding R3F1, expiry that occurs via the

\* discovering an expired invitation) is outside the composition's surface

\* =========================================================================
\* APPLICATION-LEVEL INVARIANTS
\* Names and numbering match section Composition-level invariants in the spec.
\* =========================================================================

\* Invariant 1 — Invitation gates enrollment.
\* Every enrolled Party Identity traces to an Invitation in Accepted state.
\* No party is created by any path other than a successful Onboard that
\* first satisfied the `invitations[inv].status = "pending"` gate.
\*
\* This is the composition's load-bearing emergent property. It holds
\* across all interleavings because:
\*   (a) parties[p] /= NULL is only set by the Onboard action.
\*   (b) Onboard requires invitations[inv].status = "pending" atomically.
\*   (c) After Onboard, invitations[inv].status = "accepted".
\*
Invitation_Gates_Enrollment ==
    \A p \in PartyIds :
        parties[p] /= NULL =>
            /\ invitations[parties[p].from_inv] /= NULL
            /\ invitations[parties[p].from_inv].status = "accepted"

\* Invariant 2 — Single resolution (one successful onboard per invitation).
\* Each invitation produces at most one enrolled Party Identity.
\* This is the concurrency safety claim: even when two Onboard calls for
\* the same inv fire in any interleaving, at most one can satisfy
\* `invitations[inv].status = "pending"` — the first sets it to "accepted",
\* disabling the second before it creates any records.
\*
Single_Resolution ==
    \A inv \in InvitationIds :
        Cardinality({p \in PartyIds :
            parties[p] /= NULL /\ parties[p].from_inv = inv}) <= 1

\* Invariant 3 — Credential-follows-party.
\* Every credential registered via this composition has a corresponding
\* Party Identity record, and the enrollment timestamp predates or matches
\* the credential registration timestamp.
\*
\* Structural: credentials[c] /= NULL =>
\*   (a) parties[credentials[c].principal_ref] /= NULL
\*   (b) parties[principal_ref].enrolled_at <= credentials[c].registered_at
\*
Credential_Follows_Party ==
    \A c \in CredentialIds :
        credentials[c] /= NULL =>
            LET pr == credentials[c].principal_ref
            IN  /\ parties[pr] /= NULL
                /\ parties[pr].enrolled_at <= credentials[c].registered_at

\* Invariant 4 — Full Audit Trail coverage.
\* Every terminal Invitation transition that passes through this
\* composition produces a corresponding Audit Trail event.
\*   (a) Accepted invitations → onboarding.invitation-accepted event
\*   (b) Declined invitations → invitation.declined event
\*   (c) Revoked invitations → invitation.revoked event
\*
\* Note: Expired invitations (via background scheduler, Expire action above)
\* are excluded per the spec's R3F1 finding. Invariant 4 is explicitly
\* qualified: "every terminal state change that passes through this
\* composition" — the Expire action models the scheduler-driven expiry,
\* which is outside this qualification.
\*
Audit_Coverage ==
    /\ \A inv \in InvitationIds :
           (invitations[inv] /= NULL /\
            invitations[inv].status = "accepted")

    /\ \A inv \in InvitationIds :
           (invitations[inv] /= NULL /\
            invitations[inv].status = "declined")
           => inv \in audit_declined
    /\ \A inv \in InvitationIds :
           (invitations[inv] /= NULL /\
            invitations[inv].status = "revoked")
           => inv \in audit_revoked

\* Invariant 5 — Completion record names the full arc.
\* For every invitation that completed a full successful onboard
\* (party_id /= NULL on the invitation record), the corresponding
\* Party Identity record and Credential record both exist, and the
\* credential's principal_ref matches the invitation's party_id.
\* This verifies that the spec's onboarding.completed event payload
\* {invitation_token, accepting_identity_ref, party_id, credential_id}
\* is self-consistent and references live records.
\*
Completion_Names_Full_Arc ==
    \A inv \in InvitationIds :
        (invitations[inv] /= NULL /\
         invitations[inv].party_id /= NULL) =>

                cid == invitations[inv].cred_id

\* Properties not named in section Composition-level invariants but implied by
\* the composition's step-order wiring and needed for a complete TLC check.
\* =========================================================================

\* Status monotonicity: invitation terminal states are irreversible.
\* Once an invitation is not Pending, it remains in its terminal state.
\* Checked structurally here; the temporal "always" version is enforced
\* by the action preconditions (all actions require status = "pending").
\*
Status_Monotone ==
    \A inv \in InvitationIds :
        invitations[inv] /= NULL =>
            invitations[inv].status \in InvStatuses

\* Party-to-invitation binding integrity.

Party_Invitation_Binding ==

            invitations[parties[p].from_inv] /= NULL

\* Credential-to-party binding integrity.
\* Every credential's principal_ref references an existing party record.
Credential_Party_Binding ==
    \A c \in CredentialIds :
        credentials[c] /= NULL =>
            parties[credentials[c].principal_ref] /= NULL

\* Audit events reference only existing invitations.
