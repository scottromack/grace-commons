---- MODULE reserve-from-pool ----
\* Grace Commons — Reserve from Pool composition.
\* Spec-level formal sibling of compositions/reserve-from-pool.md.
\* Derived validator; the English spec is the single source of truth. On any
\* disagreement, diagnose per the entry *The conflict protocol* in pressure-testing.md.
\*
\* WHAT THIS MODEL CHECKS
\* The composition's load-bearing wiring decision is Invariant 1 (allocation
\* coherence): the pool's running `allocated` total stays in exact lockstep with
\* the set of reservations in a slot-holding state (Held or Confirmed), and within
\* [0, Capacity]. So the pool never oversells, never strands a slot, and a
\* Confirmed reservation keeps its slot (Confirmed consumes the unit).
\*
\* Per reservation: state in {none, held, confirmed, released, expired}.
\* Global: allocated, the pool's running total.
\*   reserve  : none -> held,      allocated++ (guarded allocated < Capacity)
\*   confirm  : held -> confirmed, allocated unchanged (slot kept)
\*   cancel   : held -> released,  allocated-- (slot returned)
\*   expire   : held -> expired,   allocated-- (slot returned)
\*
\* This CORRECT model performs each slot-changing transition atomically (the host
\* transaction boundary). The buggy twin performs a non-atomic cancel that
\* releases the commitment WITHOUT returning the slot — the leak the
\* *Cross-store consistency under partial failure* edge case warns against — and
\* TLC finds the state where `allocated` exceeds the live-reservation count.
\*
\* NOT MODELED (out of scope for the load-bearing property)
\* - idempotency (Invariant 5 — see idempotent-reservation.tla).
\* - the constituent state machines and their own invariants.
\* - attribution / journaling (Invariant 6).

Confirm(r) ==
    /\ state[r] = "held"

\* CORRECT cancel: Held -> Released and the pool slot returned, atomically.
Cancel(r) ==
    /\ state[r] = "held"

    /\ allocated' = allocated - 1

\* CORRECT expire: Held -> Expired and the pool slot returned, atomically.
