---- MODULE forensic-recovery ----
\* Grace Commons — Forensic Recovery composition.
\* Spec-level formal sibling of compositions/forensic-recovery.md.
\* Derived validator; the English spec is the single source of truth. On any
\* disagreement, diagnose per the entry *The conflict protocol* in pressure-testing.md.
\*
\* WHAT THIS MODEL CHECKS (revised 2026-06-11 — closes the Invariant-4 coverage-gap finding)
\* The composition's load-bearing wiring decision is Invariant 4 (binding
\* bijection / no dangling partial), restated as safety + liveness. The headline
\* consequence is Invariant 2 (purge accountability): "no record reaches Purged
\* without an attributed audit event" — and the most consequential partial
\* failure is exactly a purge without its audit record. The design the spec
\* mandates is SEQUENTIAL-WITH-COMPENSATION: the Soft Delete lifecycle
\* transition writes first (not always reversible — Purged is terminal per Soft
\* Delete Invariant 3, so synchronous rollback is not universally available),
\* then the Audit Trail `record_action`; a failure between the two leaves an
\* ORPHAN (a lifecycle transition with no audit event) that the implementation
\* must surface immediately as a compliance finding and compensate by retrying
\* the audit write, marking the compensating event `cascade_recovery = true`.
\*
\* This model covers BOTH arms of Invariant 4 — the atomic-commit arm and the
\* compensated arm the earlier model idealized away (the coverage-matrix GAP
\* closed by the Invariant-4 coverage-gap finding; immutable-transaction-ledger.tla, revised for
\* the compensated-arm finding, is the worked template):
\*   CommitClean(t)  — both truth-bearing writes land together (the
\*                     transactional-boundary form).
\*   FailPartial(t)  — the Soft Delete write lands, the audit write fails; the
\*                     orphan is reachable AND surfaced in the same outcome
\*                     (the action's declared failure path: rejected(recording-
\*                     failure) plus the dashboard finding). The orphan is a
\*                     real inter-action state other actions can observe.
\*   RetryAudit(t)   — the compensation: the audit write retried until it
\*                     lands, marked cascade_recovery; the bijection is
\*                     restored and the recovered binding stays distinguishable
\*                     from a clean one.
\*
\* Per lifecycle transition t, TWO truth-bearing sub-writes (the
\* record_to_events list is a derived index per execution-contract.md
\* section Composition state — rebuildable by enumerating Audit Trail events whose
\* `data.record_id` names the record, grouped by lifecycle `action_ref`; outside
\* the atomicity surface; omitted from the model per that section's
\* obligation 2):
\*   softState  : absent | present                      (Soft Delete lifecycle
\*                                                       transition committed)
\*   auditState : absent | clean | recovered            (Audit Trail record_action
\*                                                       event; `recovered` carries
\*                                                       the cascade_recovery marker)
\*   surfaced   : BOOLEAN                               (orphan surfaced as a
\*                                                       compliance finding)
\*
\* SAFETY (checked here): no UNSURFACED orphan — every reachable configuration
\* is uncommitted, fully bound, or a surfaced orphan-under-compensation; a
\* lifecycle audit event never exists without its Soft Delete transition;
\* recovered bindings are distinguishable from clean ones via the
\* cascade_recovery marker. Because purge is one of the modeled transitions,
\* the safety arm carries Invariant 2's compensated path: a Purged record's
\* missing audit event can exist only as a surfaced finding under compensation.
\* LIVENESS (canonical in the English spec; see Invariant 4's liveness arm):
\* every orphan is eventually bound — Orphan(t) ~> Bound(t) under weak fairness
\* on RetryAudit. The harness checks safety invariants only; the model carries
\* the structural guarantee that discharges the obligation's enabledness half:
\* RetryAudit's enabling condition is exactly the orphan configuration, so no
\* orphan state is a dead end (the buggy twin, which deletes the compensation
\* action and the surfacing, is rejected on safety — sequential-without-
\* compensation is unsafe).
\*
\* NOT MODELED (out of scope for the load-bearing property)
\* - the Active/Deleted/Purged state machine itself (Soft Delete's own model);
\* - the within-invocation transient between the Soft Delete write and the
\*   audit attempt (within-action atomicity, not an action-vs-action
\*   interleaving; the model's states are action OUTCOMES — clean commit,
\*   surfaced partial failure).
\* - the crash-orphan (process death between the two truth-bearing writes: an
\*   orphan with no returning outcome). Within-action process death is not an
\*   action-vs-action interleaving; the English discharges it with the mandated
\*   reconciliation scan (restart + fixed cadence), which bounds its silence —
\*   see Invariant 4's safety arm and the partial-failure edge case.
\* - the deterministic-rejection compensation arm (recovery-identity
\*   re-attestation for invalid-credential / invalid-request, per the
\*   partial-failure edge case): an attribution-semantics rule, not an
\*   interleaving; RetryAudit abstracts both compensation attestations into the
\*   one `recovered` outcome.
\* - the record_to_events derived index (outside the atomicity surface per
\*   execution-contract.md section Composition state; a lost entry is a rebuild
\*   trigger, not data loss).
\* - recover_history outcome plumbing (Invariant 3 — a query-shape property);
\* - constituent invariants (Invariant 5) — each checked in its own model.

VARIABLES softState, auditState, surfaced
vars == <<softState, auditState, surfaced>>

TypeOK ==
    /\ softState  \in [Transitions -> {"absent", "present"}]
    /\ auditState \in [Transitions -> {"absent", "clean", "recovered"}]
    /\ surfaced   \in [Transitions -> BOOLEAN]

\* Every transition begins uncommitted: no Soft Delete write, no audit event,
\* no finding.
Init ==
    /\ softState  = [t \in Transitions |-> "absent"]
    /\ auditState = [t \in Transitions |-> "absent"]
    /\ surfaced   = [t \in Transitions |-> FALSE]

\* Happy path: the Soft Delete lifecycle transition and the Audit Trail
\* record_action land together (the transactional-boundary form of the
\* atomic-commit arm). The audit event is a CLEAN binding.
CommitClean(t) ==
    /\ softState[t] = "absent"
    /\ softState'  = [softState  EXCEPT ![t] = "present"]
    /\ auditState' = [auditState EXCEPT ![t] = "clean"]
    /\ UNCHANGED surfaced

\* Partial failure: the (not always reversible) Soft Delete write lands, the
\* audit write fails. The action's declared failure path returns
\* rejected(recording-failure) AND surfaces the orphan to the compliance
\* dashboard in the same outcome — the orphan is reachable, durable until
\* compensated, and never silent. For a purge transition this is Invariant 2's
\* worst case: a destroyed record awaiting its compensating audit event,
\* visible the whole time.
FailPartial(t) ==
    /\ softState[t] = "absent"
    /\ softState'  = [softState EXCEPT ![t] = "present"]
    /\ surfaced'   = [surfaced  EXCEPT ![t] = TRUE]
    /\ UNCHANGED auditState

\* Compensation: the failed AuditTrail.record_action is retried until it lands;
\* the compensating event carries cascade_recovery = true, so the recovered
\* binding stays distinguishable from a clean one. Enabled in exactly the orphan
\* configuration — no orphan state is a dead end (the liveness arm's
\* enabledness half; eventuality is weak fairness on this action).
\* The enabling condition auditState[t] = "absent" IS the spec's check-then-retry
\* rule made structural: the retrier observes the records (the rebuild read) and
\* appends only when no event names the transition, so a retry after a lost
\* acknowledgment cannot double-append (the state where the audit event already
\* landed disables this action). Per-record compensation is serialized in the
\* spec (lifecycle actions on a record_id are serialized); the model's
\* one-action-per-step semantics carries that for free.
RetryAudit(t) ==

    \/ (softState[t] = "present" /\ auditState[t] \in {"clean", "recovered"})

\* Invariant 4, safety arm — every reachable configuration is coherent or a
\* SURFACED orphan-under-compensation. There is no silent dangling partial.
Inv4_SafetyBijection == \A t \in Transitions : Coherent(t) \/ (Orphan(t) /\ surfaced[t])

\* No unsurfaced orphan: a lifecycle transition lacking its audit event is
\* always a visible finding, never a quiet inconsistency. For purge transitions
\* this is Invariant 2's compensated path made checkable.
Inv4_NoUnsurfacedOrphan == \A t \in Transitions : Orphan(t) => surfaced[t]

\* No lifecycle audit event without its Soft Delete transition (the inverse
\* orphan — unchanged from the prior model).
Inv4_NoOrphanAudit ==
    \A t \in Transitions : (auditState[t] # "absent") => (softState[t] = "present")

\* Recovered bindings are distinguishable: a clean binding never went through
