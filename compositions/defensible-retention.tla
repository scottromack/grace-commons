---- MODULE defensible-retention ----
\* Grace Commons — Regulated Record Retention & Defensible Deletion.
\* Spec-level formal sibling of compositions/defensible-retention.md.
\* Derived validator; the English spec is the single source of truth. On any
\* disagreement, diagnose per the entry *The conflict protocol* in pressure-testing.md.
\*
\* WHAT THIS MODEL CHECKS
\* The load-bearing claim is hold-blocks-purge (the named race): a record under
\* an active Legal Hold is NEVER purged, even once its retention has elapsed and
\* the record is otherwise purge-eligible. With multi-hold independence: a record
\* is purgeable only when ALL holds have been released (hold count back to zero).
\* The race the model targets: a retention-eligible purge interleaving with hold
\* placement/release — the hold must win.
\*
\* MODELING CHOICES
\* - One record. `retentionElapsed` (the retention window has passed), `holds`
\*   (count of active Legal Holds), `purged`. Ghost `purgedWhileHeld` records
\*   whether a purge ever fired while holds > 0, making "no record under hold is
\*   purged" a falsifiable predicate.
\*
\* NOT MODELED (out of scope): the Audit Trail substrate's own invariants (see
\* audit-trail.tla), retention clock arithmetic (elapse modeled as a flag flip),
\* hold identity / attribution.
