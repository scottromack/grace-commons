---- MODULE undo-history-stale-buggy ----
\* Grace Commons — Undo History composition: BUGGY TWIN (vacuity guard for Inv2).
\*
\* Identical to undo-history.tla EXCEPT `DoUndo` targets the most-recent event
\* CORRECTLY (so Inv3/Inv4 still hold) but FAILS TO RECOMPUTE the derived state —
\* it leaves `derived` stale instead of re-deriving it by replay over the new
\* undone-set. This is the precise hazard Invariant 2 forbids: the exposed state
\* must equal the replay of non-undone events, and a stale undo makes the
\* incrementally-maintained `derived` diverge from the replay (StatusOf).
\*
\* This is the Inv2-specific twin the per-invariant vacuity guard requires
\* (pressure-testing.md section the "model present" bar, criterion 2): the oldest-targeting
\* twin breaks Inv3/Inv4 but leaves Inv2 holding (its undo still recomputes derived),
\* so Inv2 needs its own witness that the check has teeth.
\*
\* Expected result: VIOLATION (Inv2 only). add(x) then undo: replay over the new
\* undone-set says x is absent, but the un-recomputed `derived` still shows x as
\* pending — derived # StatusOf, Inv2 broken. If the checker reports all invariants
\* hold here, Inv2 is vacuous.
