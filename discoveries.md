### 2026-09-10 — Prose is the half that rots, and we have two clean measurements of it in one round

Yesterday's entry argued that a controlled surface makes checks reliable. Today's repair round produced the other half of the case, and it is an observation rather than an argument: **where a claim exists in a machine-checkable form as well as in prose, the prose is the half that goes wrong.**

Two instances, same page, same round, found by a fresh reader who was given only the prose.

**One.** The page declares a configuration floor: a sweep run's disclosed bound must be at least `2 × closure_latency + journal_write_bound`. The forty-line schedule enumerator that had already refuted two earlier forms of the same page's window inequality was filtering on something else — `max(completion_bound, closure_latency + journal_write_bound) + closure_latency` — because the holder a run waits out may be an ordinary invocation, whose lease is the longer of the two. The reader found the inconsistency by reasoning about the prose alone. Re-run over the same 432 parameter tuples:

| floor | tuples admitted | window-inequality breaches among them |
|---|---|---|
| the prose's | 324 | **15** |
| the enumerator's | 288 | **0** |

So the sentence was not merely weaker. It admitted fifteen deployments the page's central liveness claim does not hold for.

**Two.** The same round's most-repeated finding — two gates running — is that a duplicate-detection key has no exemption for the one deployment mode the page itself *instructs* to produce duplicates. The formal model's corresponding invariant reads `ServiceIdentity => ~secondOpened` and has since the gate that added it. **The branch was in the model the whole time.**

In both cases the machine-readable artifact was right, the sentence was wrong, and the sentence was the *newer* of the two. That last detail is the one that matters. Nobody was careless with the prose. The prose rotted because nothing was reading it — no parser, no checker, no fixture, no failing run. A model that drifts gets caught the next time it is checked; a paragraph that drifts gets caught the next time somebody happens to read two paragraphs together and notice.

Three things follow.

**A round-end discipline, immediately.** Diff the prose against the model, the enumerator and the fixtures — in the direction of *does the page still say what the code checks*. This is the opposite of the usual direction and it is cheap, because the artifacts are few.

**A sharper reason for controlled language than the parser one.** The argument yesterday was *a controlled surface can be checked*. The stronger argument is *an unchecked surface decays*, and controlling it is how a sentence acquires a reader that never gets bored. The English is not being restricted for the machine's benefit. It is being restricted so that the sentence is inside something that will notice when it stops being true.

**And a caution about what this does not show.** Both instances are cases where a second, formal artifact already existed. That is the easy case. The hard case — the load-bearing sentence with no model behind it — is most of the corpus, and for those the only reader is the next fresh gate. Which is exactly the argument for moving more of them inside a form something can read.

### 2026-09-10 — The linter's own track record is an argument for a controlled language, and it is unanimous

Proposed by the author, relayed from an outside reader: Grace should move its load-bearing logic toward a **controlled natural language** — *semantically a superset of Cucumber, syntactically a much smaller subset of English*. Ordinary English keeps explanation, rationale and examples; normative behaviour moves to a fixed set of canonical sentence shapes. **Short sentences. One obligation per sentence. One canonical term for one meaning. No rhetorical prose inside load-bearing logic.** The point is not terseness — *the semantics are not simpler, the language is* — and the payoff is that the more primitive the normative syntax, the less intelligence the parser needs. Today the linter infers intent from unrestricted English, which is fragile; under a controlled dialect it recognizes known forms and emits a normalized representation that can feed the linter, the models, the acceptance checks and eventually generated code.

**The striking thing is that the evidence for this proposal was already sitting in the linter's history, and nobody had looked at it that way.** Eleven checks have been through the promotion pipeline. Sorting them not by what they check but by *what surface they parse*:

| outcome | parses a **controlled** form | infers from **free** prose |
|---|---|---|
| promoted, gating | **6** — the Ledger block, the Status line, the Terms registry, the signature fence, numbered steps, a bolded count claim | 0 |
| rejected in triage | 0 | **5** — own-export-vs-transcribed, what-a-step-carries, is-it-landed-elsewhere, does-a-path-have-a-bucket, is-this-name-retired |

**Six of six and five of five.** Every check this corpus has ever promoted parses a place where the language was already controlled; every check it has ever rejected was trying to read ordinary English. The rejections were each argued on their own terms at the time — the CONTAINS/CLAIMS boundary, population, whether the decidable form covers the defect — and the single sentence that predicts all five is *it was reading free prose*. The corpus has been running an unblinded experiment on this question for months and only now read the result.

**And the corpus already has three controlled sub-languages, which is why they work.** The Ledger block, the Status line and the Terms registry are all fixed-shape, and their checks are the most reliable in the suite — the Terms registry check caught a defect the round itself had introduced in three consecutive rounds. Signature fences are a fourth. What the proposal asks for is not a new idea in this corpus; it is the existing idea applied to the part of the document that carries the obligations.

**Measuring the proposed vocabulary against the corpus splits it cleanly into earned and unearned**, which matters because the author's own rule is that forms should be *discovered* — a construction appears in prose, survives pressure testing, acquires a stable meaning, gets recognizable tells, becomes mechanically checkable, and only then joins the dialect. Across 57 pattern files:

- **Earned, present in 45–57 files**: `MUST`, `MUST NOT` / *never*, `BEFORE`, `AFTER`, `EXACTLY ONE OF` / *at most one*, `IS DERIVED FROM`, `ONLY IF`. These are already the corpus's working vocabulary; canonicalizing them is writing down what is there.
- **Structural, and already half-controlled**: `COMPOSES` (a `## Composes` section in all 26 compositions) and `BINDS` (557 `x = y` spans in 37 files). The containers exist; only the sentence shapes are free.
- **Not yet earned, 2–14 files**: `IS VALID UNTIL` (3 occurrences), `IS AUTHORITATIVE FOR` (11), `RECOVERED BY` (14), `UNRECOVERABLE` (15), `WITHIN <duration> OF` (28).

**One of those unearned forms is the one the corpus most needs, and that tension is worth stating rather than resolving quietly.** `IS AUTHORITATIVE FOR` appears eleven times in seven files — and *authoritative ownership of an obligation* is the concept three consecutive gates have been about, the subject of the DRY rule the campaign just froze, and the thing every recent propagation failure is an instance of. So the concept is thoroughly earned and the **phrasing** is not. That is a real exception to discovery-over-invention: the construction has to be introduced rather than found, because the reviews proved the concept without ever settling the words. **Introducing a form is riskier than discovering one** — nothing has pressure-tested the phrasing — so it should be introduced at one site, used until it either stabilizes or is found wanting, and only then propagated. The §*Which closing stands* block on the Recoverable Invocation draft is the first such site: it names what it owns and lists its citers, which is `IS AUTHORITATIVE FOR` written out longhand.

**What this does not claim.** Not every sentence must lower into TLA+ or code. The boundary that matters is that the *protocol-bearing* part becomes structured enough to lower mechanically while genuine semantic judgement stays in readable English. The division of labour the campaign already arrived at empirically — formal layer for concurrency and timing, linter for internal consistency, fresh reader for semantics — gains a fourth member: **controlled Grace English for normative statements and bindings, ordinary English for everything else.**

### 2026-08-27 — Every derived fact has a validity duration, every claim has a lifetime, and the corpus writes down neither

Named by an outside reader of the methodology debt #19 rounds, relayed by the author: *"a derivation can be perfectly valid structurally and still cease to be usable once its evidentiary substrate expires."* Worth recording rather than nodding at, because **the campaign kept finding this dimension without looking for it**, in three classes framed as being about entirely different things.

The atomicity class was about *what commits together*. Its repairs did not close until each pattern declared a `compensation_window`, because "eventually compensated" is not a claim an auditor can test — the liveness arm became falsifiable only once it had a duration. The enumeration-anchoring class was about *whether a read can see what it quantifies over*. Its two hardest instances turned out to be temporal: Forensic Recovery's index **outlives** the source it derives from, because a retention purge destroys the payload field that source enumeration is keyed on; Multi-Party Approval's index **precedes** its source, because a chain record exists before its initiation event lands. Both broke the same move — *rebuild from the authoritative record* — and neither is a structural defect. Both are skew in time. The retention-horizon class is the dimension in its pure form, and was the only one that announced itself.

**The sharper statement, and the one the evidence actually supports.** It is not that a derivation ceases to be usable. It is that a derivation has a **validity duration**, the claim consuming it has a **lifetime**, and soundness is the comparison of the two. Propagate Consent Revocation Downstream demonstrates it cleanly, in one pattern, on one fact: `affected_scopes` is derivable from the `processing.registered` events. That derivation is **sound** for the compensation path, which runs inside a declared window measured in hours, and **unsound** for Generation acceptance check 2, which an auditor runs whenever they run it. The derivation did not change. The lifetime of the claim consuming it decided the question, and the spec had written down neither number.

**The concrete gap this points at is in the corpus's own vocabulary.** [`execution-contract.md`](execution-contract.md)'s Contract classifications — *derived index*, *extraction-pending*, *truth-bearing* — say **how** a fact is recovered and never **for how long**. That is why several of this campaign's classification-related failures were invisible to review: a spec can be perfectly conformant to the vocabulary and still assert a derivability that lapses on a schedule it does not control. Audit Trail is the pattern that noticed first and worked around it by splitting one map's classification into two by retention state — the right answer, expressed in a vocabulary with no word for it.

**And the window has two edges, which "expires" hides.** Multi-Party Approval's instance is the mirror: its store is truth-bearing *before* the event exists, so a rebuild running too early destroys the only record. Expiry is the common edge, not the only one. A derived fact is valid over an interval, and both ends of that interval have produced real defects here — one a destruction gate reading a set it could no longer rebuild, one a repair mechanism deleting the record it was repairing.

**What this does not license.** Not every fact needs a declared duration, and putting one on everything would be the usual over-correction. The discriminator the rounds converged on is narrow: **state the duration where a claim can outlive the evidence it reads.** Where the claim is bounded by construction — a compensation inside its own window, a read of a constituent's immutable record — there is nothing to declare. The rule earns its cost in the cases where the two durations are set by *different owners* who cannot see each other's, which is exactly where this campaign found its damage: an audit retention configured by one team, a business retention by another, and an invariant silently depending on the ordering.

**Status: a hypothesis with three classes of evidence, not a rule.** Recorded here rather than in [`pressure-testing.md`](pressure-testing.md) because the retention-horizon class is still open, and this campaign's own discipline is that a rule freezes when its class closes — a rule still in flight cannot be told apart from the archaeology running beside it. If it holds through the remaining instances, the shape it would take is a **temporal facet on the Contract classification** rather than a new section: every derived element states the interval over which its recovery procedure is valid, and every claim reading one states its own lifetime, so the comparison sits on the page instead of in someone's head.

### 2026-08-26 — The corpus has three different answers to "was the caller real," uses them interchangeably, and never says which is right

The joint recovery-machinery sweep settled three questions the same way in Multi-Party Approval and Execute Gated Workflow: what a recovery record must carry, which retried failures may be retried, and who signs a record emitted outside the invocation that constructed it (the composition actor, human named in the payload, `recovery = true`). Execute Gated Workflow's gate then found what the third answer rests on, and a corpus-wide triage of all eighteen credential-taking patterns turned the finding into something more interesting than the gate framed it.

**What is actually true.** Actor Identity's `attest` *does* verify: "The [Credential] must validate against the actor registry's public material for [Actor Ref]; otherwise [Invalid Credential]." The corpus is not missing authentication. What most regulated compositions have is an **ordering** problem: `attest` runs inside `record_action`, which they place *after* the load-bearing constituent write, while the constituent's own authorization — Approval Step's byte-match on `approver_ref`, Permissions' grant lookup on `actor_ref` — consumes no credential and therefore accepts an unverified actor claim. So the act commits on an asserted identity and the verification lands one step later.

**The triage board, eighteen patterns.** Six have no window at all — Audit Trail (the attest *is* the first write), Attributed Permissions Admin (attest-first as an explicit architectural commitment: "the attestation is a prerequisite, not a complement"), External Onboarding (an attempt record opens every action — the fix for a Round 2 finding), Login's own `login`, Session-Gated Authorization (writes nothing), and Actor Suspension at its default posture. Three have the window and **declare it**, in identical words: the upstream pre-check is "a deployment obligation, not an option" (Chain of Custody, Customer Onboarding, Reserve from Pool). Seven have it and declare it only conditionally or not at all — Defensible Retention, Forensic Recovery, Capability-Backed Sharing, Immutable Transaction Ledger, Propagate Consent Revocation Downstream, Resolve a Person's Data Rights, plus the two that surfaced it. And **one pattern actually verifies**: Privileged Access Provisioning calls `Credential.verify(actor_ref, credential_type, credential)` before its constituent writes at four of six actions, with a `credential_type` knob, a `[Credential Invalid]` rejection, an invariant, and an acceptance check behind it.

**So the finding is not ignorance — it is unreconciled precedent.** The same structural fact gets three treatments across the corpus: *verify it* (one pattern), *declare it an obligation* (three), *mention it as an option some deployments may want* (four), *say nothing* (the rest). Chain of Custody reached its answer by adjudicating a foundational finding word-for-word identical to the one Execute Gated Workflow just received, and closed it by declaration rather than by re-ordering. Privileged Access Provisioning reached the stronger answer in its first draft and was never asked to justify it. Nothing in the methodology says which is right, so each round picks one locally and the corpus drifts.

**Three things the triage found that are worse than the drift.** First, Forensic Recovery's prose is stronger than its wiring — "this composition records whoever calls it *with a valid credential*" is false on the purge path, where the irreversible destruction commits a step before the credential is touched. A pattern claiming a guarantee its own steps deny is a different class of defect from one that stays silent. Second, Resolve a Person's Data Rights nests the window: it purges through Defensible Retention, which itself destroys at step 4 and verifies at step 5 — an irreversible erasure of personal data with two unverified layers. Third, and sharpest: **the recovery-attribution move the sweep just installed systematically removes the human's credential check.** `attest` verifies the credential against the `actor_ref` the *composition* passed, so when a recovery re-emission passes the service identity and names the human in `data`, the substrate verifies the service and says nothing about the human. "The credential is verified inside `record_action`" is true of the substrate and false as an inherited guarantee about the person. Login already has this property everywhere by design — every Login event is attested under the application credential with the human demoted to a payload field.

**What the methodology owes.** A stated rule for which of the three answers a pattern must give, and a reason. The candidates are real and their costs differ: verifying at the composition layer costs a constituent call per action and a rejection arm, and buys a records-alone claim; declaring the obligation costs a sentence and buys nothing enforceable — no Generation acceptance check in any of the three declaring patterns tests that the deployment actually wired the pre-check. And whichever is chosen, the template needs the honest paragraph Privileged Access Provisioning is missing: `verified` establishes that material matching the principal's registered verifier was presented at that instant, not that the presenter *is* the principal, not that the presentation is bound to a channel, and not that it cannot be replayed.

### 2026-08-26 — Retry-until-lands assumes transience; deterministic rejections are the next cross-cutting shape

The re-grounding campaign's crash-seam triage round (Multi-Party Approval, Privileged Access Provisioning, Execute Gated Workflow, Login, External Onboarding) closed its findings with one template: markers that carry their payload, markers written before the acts they cover, and a restart sweep that re-derives every owed audit record from durable state, **retrying until it lands**. Execute Gated Workflow's full-residue gate (its Lineage §Final Critique 8, F1) promptly found the template's blind spot: *retry-until-lands is only a recovery when the failure is transient.* Two of the substrate's `record_action` rejection arms are **deterministic** — `invalid-credential` (the attesting credential is revoked; every retry re-presents the same dead credential) and `invalid-request` (the constructed payload exceeds the wired instance's cap; every retry re-sends the same oversized payload) — and against those, "until it lands" never lands: the quarantine never lifts, the alert stands forever, and a re-invoke mints an unbounded stream of quarantined orphans.

The shape is cross-cutting by construction, because the crash-seam round *installed the same retry obligation in five patterns on the same day*. Every retry-until-lands written into Multi-Party Approval's transition sweep, Privileged Access Provisioning's entry closures, Login's issuance-reconciliation sweep, and External Onboarding's record retries carries the same unexamined transience assumption — their gates simply have not re-run yet to say so. The two-part fix Execute Gated Workflow's routed finding prescribes generalizes: **(a) foreclose the deterministic payload arm before the load-bearing write** (budget-derived caps on every field the constructed event carries — the move Multi-Party Approval and Privileged Access Provisioning already made for caller inputs, extended to composition-built payloads like a full `gate_spec`), and **(b) give the deterministic credential arm a terminal landing** (re-emit the pending record under the composition actor with the human in `data` and `recovery = true` — the attribution rule Login already made universal, and the reason its retries are, alone among the five, credential-deterministic-safe already: a composition-attributed retry cannot be killed by a *caller's* revoked credential, only by the deployment's own service credential, which is a pageable operational fault rather than an unreachable contract state).

**Triage implication, recorded for the next round:** fold the deterministic-rejection question into the Families 3–4 pass as its own themed sweep — audit every retry-until-lands obligation in the five patterns for the two deterministic arms, foreclose or land each — rather than letting five closing gates rediscover it one pattern at a time. The general rule it suggests for the methodology: **a retry obligation is only well-formed when the spec names which of the retried call's rejection arms are transient — and gives every non-transient arm its own landing.** A retry loop over an enumerated rejection taxonomy that never partitions it is the same unexamined claim the campaign keeps finding under different names: an arm the wiring can reach with nowhere declared to go.

### 2026-07-06 — Structured density: dense text is only a bridge when it carries handles

A day of external readability reviews (three model families critiquing the site and the roadmap) kept producing the same request — summaries, dashboards, executive overviews — and every request was satisfiable **by projection, with zero edits to canon**: per-pattern cards and the composition-graph page derived in an afternoon (`tools/taxonomy/generate_graph.py`, `_data/patterns.json`), the roadmap dashboard deferred to the same generated-view plan, the landing-page child lists auto-rendered. The counterexample arrived the same day: a reviewer's hand-written summary of the Branching Undo candidate drifted from its source *within the hour* — restating as an open challenge an acid test the row had already resolved.

The finding: **verbosity is only the architecture of the bridge when the verbose text is addressable.** The corpus projects cleanly not because it is dense but because its density carries handles — status tokens with a pinned grammar, invariants named-then-numbered, declared `## Composes` edges, dated markers, required section names. Prose that is merely thick resists every audience; prose that is thick *and* addressable projects to any of them, human or machine, including summarizers that have not been built yet. The one-line form: **dense and readable are not contradictory when the writing is structured.** Structure is the single property that serves both readers — predictable places for the human eye (named sections, topic sentences, invariants named-then-numbered) and stable handles for the deriving machine (tokens, edges, dated markers) — and unlike "well-written," *structured* is checkable: the linter already enforces pieces of it. Call the property **structured density**: one discipline, both readabilities, with every further audience served by projection rather than edit.

This is the same insight as 2026-05-19 (readable-first and formally verifiable are one discipline), 2026-05-20 (complexity reduced to named state before tools apply), and 2026-06-08 (the rigor lives in the substrate; derivations fall out for free), extended to the audience problem: **audience tuning is a derivation, and derivations are only as good as the substrate's handles.** The authoring rule it implies is cheap: when adding dense content, add its handle in the same edit — a token, a number, a declared edge, a dated marker — because the handle is what every future view hangs from.

### Implication for Grace Commons

The open readability ↔ completeness question ([`open-questions.md`](./open-questions.md)) may resolve here: the readability discipline that *sticks* is not a prose sweep (those decayed) and not a hand summary (those drift) — it is handles-at-authoring-time plus derived views, enforced the way the acronym and status-grammar rules already are. Write for all audiences by tuning toward density, and let projection do the tuning — which only works if the density is structured. Honest bound: the evidence is one corpus and one day of reviews; the claim earns more weight each time a new audience's view derives without touching canon, and loses it the first time a needed view can't be derived because a handle is missing.

### 2026-06-23 — Derive-expiry-at-read applies only to *side-effect-free* lapse

A corpus-wide "derive expiry at read time" pass (remove the stored `Expired` terminal and the `expire()` write; compute `Expired` as a read-time projection from the injected clock vs the deadline — the *derive the idealization, don't lag it with a flag* discipline) ran cleanly across seven temporal atoms: Invitation, Session, Capability, Credential, Retention Window, Selective Disclosure, Consent. It **broke on the eighth — Provisional Commitment — and the break is the rule.**

PC's lapse is not a pure idealization: when a hold's window elapses it **returns a resource to availability** (a Capacity Constraint pool slot), a side effect that the Reservation Lifecycle (C9) and Idempotent Reservation compositions hang on `ProvisionalCommitment.expire(id)`. Removing `expire()` left those two grounded compositions calling a deleted action — a live cascade — so PC was reverted to its Final Critique 4 stored-`Expired` + `expire()` form, and the compositions went consistent again untouched.

**The rule:** derive-expiry-at-read is correct exactly when a lapse has **no side effect** — the entity simply becomes unusable and "is it expired?" is answered by a pure read (an Invitation can't be accepted, a Session/Credential won't verify, a Capability won't redeem). The moment a lapse must *do* something — release a slot, emit a notification, fire a cascade — it is a state transition with an event, not an idealization, and it keeps its explicit `expire()`/sweep. The discriminator is the EOS one: does the lapse carry a side effect of its own? Side effect ⇒ it owns an event; no side effect ⇒ derive it.

This also exercised the freshly-recalibrated cycle the right way and the wrong way: the cross-cutting change *should* have been gated on a single reference before the sweep ([`pressure-testing.md`](./pressure-testing.md) §Reference-first for cross-cutting changes), which would have surfaced the PC exception at one atom instead of after eight — the worked motivation for that very rule.

### 2026-06-14 — The camelCase-for-TLC naming split is gone; the adapter derives the name

Supersedes the 2026-05-23 rename. That one renamed `.tla` files to lower-camelCase because standard TLA+ (SANY) requires the module name to match the filename and rejects hyphens — at the time the only way to make the models runnable under standard TLC. The cost was a naming split: kebab `.md`/`.als`, camelCase `.tla`.

[`tools/harness/tla-adapter.mjs`](./tools/harness/tla-adapter.mjs) removes the trade — it *derives* a TLC-valid camelCase copy from a canonical kebab-case `.tla` on demand (rewriting the `MODULE` line; the repo's WASM checker tolerates hyphens, so the kebab file runs in-harness as-is). The three remaining camelCase models — Attributed Permissions Admin, External Onboarding, Privileged Access Provisioning — were renamed back to kebab, so every model filename now matches its `.md`/`.als` siblings while standard TLC stays reachable through the adapter (output in git-ignored `build-tlc/`). Verified faithful: all three hold at identical state counts (397 / 172 / 1682). The TLC name is now a derived artifact, not a hand-maintained variant — derive-don't-lag, applied to filenames.

### 2026-06-14 — Separation-of-duty is named everywhere but enforced nowhere

Witness-checking a proposed "Mutual Exclusion / Separation-of-Duty" invariant template (from the Grok strange-pattern forecast, [`working-ideas/no-global-services.md`](./working-ideas/no-global-services.md) §Strange-pattern forecast) turned up an absence: the library enforces separation-of-duty — *the actor who submits an object cannot be the actor who approves it* — **nowhere** as a standing invariant. The three places a skeptic would point to are three *different* shapes, none of them SoD: Approval Step Inv 4/5 is *authorization-exclusivity* (only the actor bound to `approver_ref` / `submitter_ref` may act — a role→actor binding that says nothing about the two being distinct); Multi-Party Approval's pairwise-distinct approvers is an `invalid-request` *validation precondition* on `initiate_chain`, not a standing invariant, and constrains distinctness *within the approver set*, not submitter-vs-approver; Assignment's "at most one Active per task" is *cardinality*. **Implication:** a builder of four-eyes / maker-checker approval must add SoD explicitly — it is not inherited from Approval Step or Multi-Party Approval. The decision this raises (enforce via a disjointness template, a composition, or leave it to callers) graduates to [`open-questions.md`](./open-questions.md) only when a pattern actually forces it; until then this is just the found fact. (By `spec-format.md`'s structural-relation promotion bar — *a relation-wide truth-condition that recurs and owns no state* — the apparent "mutual exclusion" template disaggregates: *cardinality / at-most-one* already has a clean standing witness in Assignment and is the stronger near-term fifth-template candidate, while *disjointness / SoD* is shape-valid but witness-thin.)

### 2026-06-13 — The taxonomy run in reverse: nine real systems saturate onto the atom set

The forward thesis is *English spec (canonical) → model + code (derived)*. We spent a session running it **backwards** — *code → recovered concepts* — against deployed software, to try to **falsify** the taxonomy. The question, phrased to fail: as you mine real systems, does the corpus keep minting primitives the library lacks, or keep resurfacing the same atoms? This is the reverse-direction twin of the emergent-invariant saturation metric in [`working-ideas/falsifiability-metric.md`](./working-ideas/falsifiability-metric.md).

Nine runs ([`working-ideas/recovery/`](./working-ideas/recovery/)), deliberately spread to break every confound a skeptic would name:

- **Languages (5):** JavaScript (`pboyer/rec`), Python (`asgi-idempotency-header`, ERPNext, hrms, frappe/crm, Odoo), Java (OpenMRS), PHP (Akaunting), TypeScript (Medplum).
- **Domains (5):** utility, ERP, CRM, clinical/EHR, accounting.
- **Frameworks (6):** vanilla, ASGI, Frappe, Odoo-ORM, Spring/Hibernate, Laravel — and, in the final run, the **FHIR international standard** rather than any one vendor's model.

The result is **saturation**: the existing atom set recurred as the substrate in every system. The load-bearing results:

- **Three grounded atoms validated in the wild *and* against the standard.** Clinical Observation's branch-free amendment chain is OpenMRS `Obs.previousVersion` (Java) and FHIR `Observation` (status `final`→`amended`); Medication Order is OpenMRS `Order.Action`/`previousOrder` and FHIR `MedicationRequest`; Provenance is FHIR `Provenance` (agent/recorded/activity/entity/signature — the `signature` also cross-checks Tamper Evidence). The worked-example atoms were not idealized; they recovered how real EHRs and the interoperability standard actually model their data.
- **The gap set converged instead of sprawling.** Mining did not keep minting un-absorbable primitives — it resurfaced the same short candidate list, and by the last two runs was producing *refinements*, not new primitives (the shape the falsifiability metric calls "thesis strengthens"). The candidates, seeded into [`roadmap.md`](./roadmap.md) §Concept-recovery atom backlog: **Acyclic Recursive Composition** (five witnesses across five systems and languages — ERPNext/Odoo BOM, OpenMRS `obsGroup`/`ConceptSet`, Akaunting `Category`, FHIR `Observation.hasMember`), **Coded Category + Terminology Binding** (whose three-part structure FHIR's `CodeSystem`/`ValueSet`/`ConceptMap` supplied), **Sequential Identifier**, the weaker Orthogonal-state and Deadline/SLA, and **Balance Ledger** as a composition pattern.
- **Two executed bugs and a confirmed prediction**, from the small targets where the code could actually be run: a COMPOUND-return contract violation in `rec` that its types and ~1M-trial suite both missed; a bricked-idempotency-key bug in `asgi-idempotency-header`; and confirmation of the predicted *Idempotency Result Memo* atom in that middleware's response cache.
- **Saturation includes a correct *absence*.** Single-entry Akaunting *lacks* the debit = credit binding-bijection invariant that double-entry Odoo (`account.move._check_balanced`) carries. The taxonomy expressing both — present in one system, correctly absent in the other — is a sharper result than uniform confirmation.

#### Implication for Grace Commons

Convergence-not-divergence is the empirical signal that the atoms carve real joints rather than fitting the library's own examples — and the strongest form of it is matching an international standard (FHIR) that a committee designed independently over a decade. This is the reverse-direction confirmation of the forward saturation thesis: the same claim, instrumented from the other end and re-runnable on any new corpus.

Two honest bounds. **Depth was mostly read, not run:** on the framework-heavy targets (ERPNext, Odoo, OpenMRS, Akaunting, FHIR) tier-3 recovered invariants from source but did not execute them — only `rec` and `asgi` produced reproduced bugs; the rest are confirmations. And each **domain still rests on one or two witnesses**, so *approximately sufficient* is the honest strength, not *complete*. The recovery files are internal staging; their canon-facing residue is the seeded candidate backlog and this entry.

The reverse pipeline turned out to be two things at once: a **falsification instrument** for the taxonomy (mine N systems; does the candidate set stay bounded?) and the **adoption on-ramp** the thesis most needed an answer for (code → concept-map → the four-destination audit answers "what about my legacy system"). Both were the point; neither needed the forward pipeline to be finished first.

### 2026-06-12 — Status mirrors in Summaries go stale; two were already lying

While landing C11, a consistency sweep found ten patterns carrying a status claim inside their Tier-1 Summary ("This composition is `grounded`…"). Two had already drifted into falsehood: Authenticated Actor's Summary still said `partially resolved` after grounding on 2026-06-10, and Data Subject Rights Fulfillment's still said "drafting in progress" after grounding on 2026-06-09. Nothing lints a Summary sentence — the status-mirror check covers only the roadmap cell against the Status token.

The lesson is the no-snapshot rule wearing a new coat: any prose restatement of a status token is a mirror, and unlinted mirrors drift. Status now lives in exactly two places — the pattern's `## Status` token (source of truth) and the roadmap cell (linted mirror). All ten Summary status sentences were removed the same day; the spec-format note "(Grounded specs only)" governs when a Summary is written, never what it claims about status.

### 2026-05-19 — Readable-first and formally verifiable are the same discipline

While modeling the Attributed Permissions Admin composition in Alloy and TLA+, we discovered that the English specification had already captured nearly everything the formal models required: named actions, preconditions, postconditions, and explicitly numbered invariants.

This challenged the common assumption that human-readable specifications and formal verification are separate activities—one for people, one for tools.

In practice, they are two expressions of the same underlying discipline: precise thinking.

The canonical English specification is where the difficult work happens:

* Defining system state
* Naming actions
* Stating invariants
* Clarifying assumptions
* Eliminating ambiguity

Once that structure exists, generating Alloy or TLA+ models becomes largely mechanical.

The English specification is not documentation *about* the formal model. It is the canonical source from which both formal models and implementation are derived.

Formal tools act as tireless second readers. They do not create correctness; they systematically test the assumptions already expressed in the specification by exploring states no human would enumerate manually.

A key advantage of this approach is that verification results return in the language the team already understands. Invariants are named in English before the model is written, so counterexamples map directly to concepts already discussed in design reviews.

The feedback loop is straightforward:

**English specification → Formal model → Counterexamples → Refined specification**

Readable-first design forced exactly the level of abstraction that formal verification requires.

### Implication for Grace Commons

Writing a precise English specification is not formal verification itself, but it performs most of the intellectual work that formal verification depends on.

Alloy and TLA+ then provide exhaustive, machine-assisted validation of that specification.

When the specification is precise enough, formal verification becomes an optional, mechanical extension of the same thinking rather than a separate discipline.

### 2026-05-20 — Complexity must be reduced to named state and named transitions before advanced tools apply

Discovered while writing the Alloy model for Capability and the TLA+ model for Privileged Access Provisioning. Both models were straightforward to write — not because formal verification is easy, but because the grounded specs had already done the hard work.

The gating condition that made the models tractable: every piece of complexity had already been reduced to named state and named transitions. Status enums, action preconditions, idempotency guards, invariants — all named in the English spec before a single line of Alloy or TLA+ was written.

This suggests a general principle:

> Complexity must be reduced until it is representable as named state and named transitions before advanced logic tools are applied.

That principle is the gating rule between three stages:

1. **Prose design** — where the hard thinking happens; complexity is named and decomposed
2. **Formal verification** — mechanical once stage 1 is complete; Alloy checks snapshots, TLA+ checks traces
3. **Code generation** — also mechanical from the same source; implementation is a translation, not a design activity

The same rule applies to decomposition generally. Complex things become doable when broken down far enough that their pieces can be named. The naming is the work. Everything after naming is translation.

This is the same insight as the 2026-05-19 discovery stated from the other direction: readable-first and formally verifiable are the same discipline because both require the same prior act — reducing complexity to named state.

### Implication for Grace Commons

The three-pass pressure-testing methodology is the mechanism that enforces the gating rule. A pattern that has not survived all three passes has not been reduced far enough. Alloy and TLA+ applied to an ungrounded spec will find noise, not signal — the counterexamples will reflect specification gaps rather than implementation risks.

The correct sequencing is: ground the spec first, then apply formal tools. The formal tools confirm the grounding; they do not substitute for it.

### 2026-05-23 — TLA+ filename↔module rule forces a camelCase exception for .tla files

Discovered when the first CLI-driven TLC run hit `login.tla` and SANY rejected it: TLA+ requires every `.tla` file to declare `MODULE <name>` where `<name>` is the file's basename, and TLA+ identifiers cannot contain hyphens (`-` is the subtraction operator). A file named `external-onboarding.tla` cannot declare `MODULE external-onboarding` (lexer error) or any matching-but-hyphen-free module name without violating the filename-must-match rule.

All four `.tla` files in `compositions/` had the same mismatch — kebab-case filename, CamelCase or snake_case module name. The TLA+ Toolbox GUI papers over this via internal resolution; the `tlc` CLI does not. CLI reproducibility is the bar a grant reviewer or external contributor will hit on first try.

### Resolution

Rename the four `.tla` files to lower-camelCase to match their MODULE declarations: `login.tla`, `external-onboarding.tla`, `attributed-permissions-admin.tla`, `privileged-access-provisioning.tla`. Paired `.cfg` files follow the same names. Every other file type — `.md`, `.als`, atom names, directory names — stays kebab-case. The exception is scoped narrowly to the file type whose parser refuses to negotiate.

### Future work — adapter

A short build step could restore the kebab-case convention as the canonical surface: a pre-flight script creates a temporary directory of correctly-named symlinks or copies, invokes TLC against the temporary tree, and reports results back through the original kebab-case names. Worth doing once the build pipeline justifies a single canonical adapter location, or once a contributor wants a `.tla` file more readable than camelCase allows.

### Principle

The English spec and the formal-methods sibling are two expressions of the same discipline (2026-05-19 discovery), but the formal tool brings its own constraints. Accept the constraint where it is mechanical and unavoidable; defer the elegance of a unified surface to a build step rather than letting it bleed into the source filenames.

### 2026-05-20 — Healthcare application target

A specific healthcare application idea is in view as a future Grace Commons target. Not captured in detail yet at the author's request — noted here so it doesn't get lost. The library already has Clinical Observation and Medication Order as grounded worked examples of the methodology applied to HIPAA / 21 CFR Part 11 domains. The healthcare app would extend into composition territory beyond those two atoms. Detail to be filled in when the idea is ready to specify.

### 2026-06-05 — Cross-render agreement is an empirical measure of spec-carried meaning

While building the conformance validator (`tools/conformance/`), we rendered the same composition surface (the clinical-trial-portal: External Onboarding + Login + Session-Gated Authorization + Attributed Permissions Admin + Audit Trail) four separate times, on four genuinely different stacks:

* render 1 — SQLite, Deno, Argon2id
* render 2 — SQLite, pure Node, scrypt
* render 3 — **Postgres** (pglite, in-WASM), pbkdf2
* render 4 — **flat-file JSONL** event log, no SQL at all

The same spec-derived manifest, the same evaluators, and the same user-journey scenario drive all four. Only a small per-render *adapter* differs. Nineteen of the twenty record-clearable checks pass **identically** across all four renders.

The discovery is what the *disagreement* does. The single check the renders split on (the audit hash-chain integrity check) does not indicate a spec gap — it localizes a defect that exists in exactly one render (render 1's genesis-hash bug; see happy_accidents.md). So multi-render agreement is a measurement instrument, not just a test:

> A claim that passes identically across independent renders is *carried by the spec*. A disagreement is either a render-specific defect or a place the spec under-determines behavior — and the divergence points at which render is the outlier.

This is the empirical handle on the project's core thesis (*code is a build artifact; the spec is canonical*). When implementations on SQLite, Postgres, and a flat file all converge on the same behavior, the behavior is coming from the shared spec, not from shared code — because there is no shared code.

### Implication for Grace Commons

The agreement percentage (`tools/conformance/agree.mjs`, N renders) is a number a grant reviewer or skeptic can re-run. It exits non-zero on any disagreement, so it doubles as a CI gate on spec-carried behavior: a future render that diverges from the others is flagged automatically, and the flag names the exact claim and the exact render.

---

### 2026-06-05 — An independently-derived render converged on the same number

Render 4 above was authored by an agent given **isolated context**: only the five composition specs and the validator's integration contract — never the other three renders, never the reference implementation. From that alone it chose a paradigm none of the others used (an append-only JSONL ledger, no relational engine) and produced a render that scores 100% on the shared manifest and agrees with the others on all nineteen spec-carried claims.

The honest scope of the claim: this is *isolated-context* independence, not a different human or a different model family — so it shrinks the "the same author wrote all the renders, maybe they share a blind spot" objection without fully eliminating it. A render authored by a different person or model is the remaining step.

But the signal is real: handed the canonical English and the records-alone contract, an independent implementer reconstructed the same behavior. That is the strongest available evidence that the meaning lives in the specification, not in any one implementation of it.

---

### 2026-06-05 — The Generation-acceptance prose *is* the conformance oracle

Every grounded spec already carries a *Generation acceptance* section written in records-alone form ("an auditor, from the records alone, can verify X"). Building the validator, we did not design conformance tests — we *lifted* the checks the specs already state. A dependency-free, linter-class parser (`extract-manifest.mjs`) pulls `{claim, kind}` straight out of the Generation-acceptance prose; a `--reconcile` pass then proves the hand-authored check manifest is **zero-drift faithful** to the spec: every manifest claim is verbatim-present in the prose, and every spec check is accounted for.

The reconcile earned its keep immediately — it caught the manifest author (us) over-classifying three checks relative to the spec's own framing, and forced the correction. It also enforces that any deliberate deviation carries a written reason, or it fails.

### Implication for Grace Commons

"The spec is the test" is not aspirational here; it is mechanical. The checkable claims are traceable to the canonical English. The only judgment that stays hand-authored is render-specific scoping (which checks a given render's substrate covers, and severity) — and that part is small, explicit, and itself auditable.

---

### 2026-06-05 — Once correctness is measured, it is optimized: the validator is a fitness function

The same number that *measures* a render can *select* among candidate fixes. A regen loop (`regen.mjs`) reads the validator's red checks, proposes a render edit addressing each, re-measures, and keeps the edit only if the measured correctness rose — climbing a deliberately-broken render from 90% to 100% over two fixes, and refusing a regressive patch (it reverts and exits non-zero).

This closes the level-1 feedback loop end to end — generate → check → fix → retest — with the spec as the oracle the whole way down. The validator is simultaneously the acceptance test (does this render honor the spec?) and the fitness function (drive the render toward the spec). The number is computed, never asserted; an author may claim "92%-good," but the runner *counts*.

---

### 2026-06-05 — The validator's first act was catching a real audit bug nobody was looking for *(happy accident)*

We built the conformance validator to *measure* how faithfully a render honors its spec — to produce a number, not to hunt bugs. Pointed at render 1 (the clinical-trial-portal demo), the very first run came back 95%, with exactly one red: the audit hash chain diverges at event #1.

It was not a contrived check failing. It was a genuine, latent defect in the demo: `scripts/seed.ts` hashes the genesis `study.registered` event **without** the `id` field, while `domain/event_log.ts` (`appendEvent` / `verifyChain`) hashes **with** it. The consequence is real and Part-11-relevant: a CRA clicking `/audit/verify` on a **pristine, untampered** database would see *"Tamper detected at event #1."* Worse, because `verifyChain` stops at the first divergence, the genesis break **masks all downstream tamper detection** — the chain is never actually checked past row 1. The demo's own test suite never exercised `verifyChain` over the seeded event, so the bug was invisible to it. The validator surfaced it on contact, and it reproduced on the live Deno render three separate times on fresh data.

Then the accident compounded, twice:

1. **The fixture reproduced the bug by being faithful.** A byte-faithful Node fixture, written to stand in for the Deno render in a sandbox without Deno, reproduced the seed's *exact* stored hash — genesis bug and all. We proved the fixture was a faithful stand-in by accidentally reproducing a defect we already knew was there.
2. **Multi-render agreement triangulated it for free.** As we added renders 2, 3, and 4, cross-render agreement *localized* the bug: render 1 disagrees with the other three on exactly that one check, out-voting the defect 3-to-1 and proving it render-specific, not a property of the spec. No logic was written to find or isolate the bug — the agreement machinery did it as a side effect.

We did **not** patch it (the demo is frozen while funding is pending; the fix re-hashes the whole chain). It is logged for the demo's review channel. *(Superseded — noted 2026-06-11: the freeze decision was later reversed and the fix landed in `scripts/seed.ts` — the genesis row is now hashed with `id`, matching the append path; existing seeded databases must be re-seeded. See `changelog.md` §Fixed. This entry is preserved as the dated record of the decision as made.)* The point for the record is the pattern, not the patch: an independent oracle finds what an implementation's own tests cannot, because the tests and the code share blind spots — they were written by the same hand, against the same assumptions. The conformance check, derived from the spec rather than the code, does not share those blind spots. *"We built a tool to measure correctness, and the first thing it did was find a real audit-integrity bug the hand-written tests missed, then localize it across four renders without being told to"* is the cleanest one-sentence case for the approach.

---

### 2026-06-05 — Postgres-in-WASM made "a second full render is hard" answerable in an afternoon *(happy accident)*

The skeptic's specific doubt was that a second *full* render — especially on a real database like Postgres — would be hard. Two unplanned conveniences collapsed that:

* Node 22 ships `node:sqlite` and `node:crypto` as built-ins, so the validator core and two of the renders need **zero** installed dependencies.
* `pglite` runs **real PostgreSQL (18.3), compiled to WASM, in-process** — no server, no `apt`, no Docker. A genuine Postgres render became a single `npm install` and an async adapter.

Render 3 (Postgres) joined the entire pipeline by writing only two small adapters; render 4 (a flat-file JSONL store) was authored independently and dropped in the same way. The "hard" second render turned out to be a contract-shaped seam, not a rebuild — the engine differences (async vs sync, SQL vs flat file) were absorbed by the adapter layer the architecture already had.

---

### 2026-06-06 — Re-render confirmed an existing invariant rather than surfacing a new one

Building the second render of the clinical-trial-portal (Next.js + React Server Components on PostgreSQL), the one genuinely new engineering surface was global serialization of the audit hash chain: every mutation takes a single `pg_advisory_xact_lock` so two concurrent appends cannot read the same tail and fork the chain (BUILD_PLAN §4). The first render got this for free from SQLite's single-writer lock and never had to think about it.

The tempting reading — and the one BUILD_PLAN §4.3 reaches for — is that the swap *surfaced* an under-specified ordering assumption: a spec gap one stack had been hiding, now dragged into the open and worth depositing back into the library as a named invariant.

Checking the canonical source refutes that. The Event Log atom (`atoms/event-log.md`) already carries it:

- **Invariant 3 — Total order.** Any two distinct events have a defined relative position by `sequence_number`; ties never occur, even within a single wall-time instant.
- Operationally: *"appends never fail for ordering or contention reasons — the underlying implementation must serialize them."*

So the requirement that concurrent appends be totally ordered was already in the spec. The swap did not expose a missing invariant — it exercised an existing one. SQLite's single-writer lock and Postgres's `pg_advisory_xact_lock` are two *mechanisms* conforming to the same atom clause. What is non-portable is the mechanism, not the invariant: SQLite satisfies "must serialize them" for free; Postgres satisfies it with an explicit lock. That distinction is a render / EXECUTION_CONTRACT fact, not a spec change.

This is the cleaner result for the thesis, not the weaker one. The 2026-06-05 genesis-hash finding was a real discovery — the validator *localized a defect*. This one localizes nothing, and that is the point: it confirms a canonical invariant holds across two unrelated serialization mechanisms. "The spec already said it" is exactly what *canonical* is supposed to mean.

### Implication for Grace Commons

The meta-lesson is a guardrail on atom count. The pull to "crystallize the §4 invariant into the Audit Trail composition" would have added a fragment the Event Log atom already states — a redundant invariant, an avoidable atom. The smallest-set-of-atoms discipline has a precondition: before crystallizing an apparent finding into a new invariant or atom, check whether the canonical source already carries it. Here it did, twice over (Invariant 3 plus the operational serialize clause).

Two doc-level follow-ups, neither a spec change: (1) the conformance mapping — Event Log's *"the underlying implementation must serialize them"* → SQLite single-writer (render 1) / `pg_advisory_xact_lock` (render 2) — belongs in EXECUTION_CONTRACT (or the render's CORNERS), as a worked instance of one atom clause satisfied by two mechanisms; (2) BUILD_PLAN §4.3/§9's "the English was under-specified about ordering" overstates against the atom and should be reconciled to "the *mechanism* is non-portable; the invariant was already stated." Re-render is a conformance check on spec-carried meaning — agreement across mechanisms confirms completeness, and an exciting narrative is not a reason to grow the atom set.

**Addendum (later, same day) — render 3 lands the third mechanism.** A headless Go render of the same Event Log spec (`demos/clinical-trial-portal-go`) satisfies the serialize clause with a `sync.Mutex`, and a Go-emitted chain verifies byte-for-byte under the JS canonical contract. The mapping is now *three* mechanisms (SQLite single-writer / `pg_advisory_xact_lock` / Go `sync.Mutex`), and follow-up (1) above is done — it is recorded in `execution-contract.md` (Data layer contract). One genuinely new thing the Go port surfaced: the canonical-JSON contract must be pinned *explicitly* for any non-TypeScript target — no HTML escaping, non-ASCII emitted raw, integers-only, key sort by code point. JS satisfied all four implicitly, so renders 1–2 never had to state them; a generator targeting a third language can't rely on "the runtime happens to." That list is the real portable artifact of the third render.

### 2026-06-07 — Fourth engine, same split: the invariants are spec-carried; Postgres carried only the enforcement locus

The Mongo ghost render (`demos/clinical-trial-portal-mongo`) was built to ask the question the first three engines couldn't: what happens to the invariants when the declarative layer disappears entirely? MongoDB has no foreign keys, no CHECK constraints, and no schema-level delete discipline — every guarantee the Postgres schema enforced for free has to go *somewhere*, and the render's job was to say exactly where (the invariant → enforcer table in its README).

The answer splits into three enforcement classes, and the split itself is the finding:

- **Engine-enforced (ports losslessly).** `NOT NULL`, the `CHECK` enums, every `UNIQUE` constraint, and the single-row `CHECK (id = 1)` all re-express as `$jsonSchema` validators and unique indexes — a violating write is rejected by the store, same as Postgres. One pleasant surprise in this class: `bsonType: "string"` on the hashed fields (`occurred_at` / `payload_json` / `prev_hash` / `this_hash`) machine-enforces the opaque-strings rule the hash chain's byte-identity depends on. A BSON `Date` or nested document — the coercion that would silently break cross-render verification — is rejected by the engine. What was a porting *convention* in renders 1–3 is a store-enforced *constraint* in render 4.
- **App-code-enforced (does not port — the class to watch).** FK existence and `ON DELETE RESTRICT` have no Mongo equivalent. They move into portal code paths: explicit existence lookups inside the transaction for externally-supplied references, structural derivation for op-internal ones, and — for delete discipline — the *absence of any delete surface*, which is categorically weaker than Postgres actively refusing the delete no matter which client asks. Same invariants, demoted enforcement: from engine-unconditional to audited-code-paths. The conformance checks still measure the invariants from the records; what's gone is the engine standing between the code and a violation.
- **Runtime-mechanism (the EXECUTION_CONTRACT seam, now four deep).** The Event Log serialize clause gets its fourth conforming mechanism: a replica-set multi-document transaction with the unique `event_log._id` as fork guard and `withTransaction`'s optimistic retry absorbing contention. Two concurrent appends collide on the same `_id`; the engine aborts one as a transient conflict; the retry re-reads the tail and lands after it. A forked append is impossible (it's a conflict, not a fork) and contention never surfaces to the caller — both halves of the clause, and *measured* rather than asserted (`prove-serialization.mjs`: 24 genuinely concurrent ops → no fork, no gap, chain re-verifies). SQLite single-writer / `pg_advisory_xact_lock` / Go `sync.Mutex` / Mongo conflict-retry: one canonical clause, four unrelated mechanisms.

Like 2026-06-06, the no-discovery is the headline: nothing surfaced a missing invariant, no spec contradiction rose to a finding (the deltas that are real but preference-shaped are in the render's CORNERS). The render passes the same 20 conformance checks through the unchanged evaluators, the cross-render agreement holds at 100% with it included, and the mongod-stored chain re-verifies byte-identically under the Go render's `verify.mjs`. The portable artifact of the fourth render is the *table*: a named list of exactly which guarantees a reviewer must re-audit as code whenever a render targets an engine without a declarative layer. That list is what "the spec is canonical, the engine is a mechanism" looks like when the engine gives you nothing for free.

### 2026-06-08 — Classification is computable from the intent graph, and the substrate — not the derivation — is the achievement

The taxonomy dry run (a read-only reverse-index generator over 18 compositions / 27 atoms / 47 composition→atom edges) asked whether an atom's classification could be *derived* from the composition graph instead of *asserted* by a folder. It can, and the result was sharper than the proposal that motivated it predicted:

- The reverse index reproduced 12 of 13 defensible `compliance/` placements, and the 13th (`selective-disclosure`, uncomposed) is exactly the intrinsic-stewardship carve-out — derivation drives navigation; the overlay-authoring obligation travels with the atom.
- It surfaced the real defect the folders hid: **10 regulated-by-usage atoms filed *outside* `compliance/`**, the flagship being Event Log — the single most heavily-regulated atom in the library by usage (14 standards; it is the audit substrate) — filed under `temporal/` because that is its intrinsic *shape*. A folder is a name and a classification at once; an atom has several true classifications; the folder forces a guess about which axis wins, and Event Log is where the guess is most wrong.
- A brand-new overlay (security) dropped in clean on the first try — computed identically to `regulated`, it clustered onto exactly the 7 auth/identity atoms and stayed off every domain-payload atom, with no hand-curation. The one axis that *couldn't* be derived (domain) is precisely the one that needs an intrinsic, EOS-gated tag. The split is load-bearing.

The deeper finding is methodological and generalizes past taxonomy: **the rigor lives in the substrate, not in the derivation.** The generator is ~150 lines of graph inversion; the reason it produces trustworthy classifications is that the expensive part was already done — 27 pressure-tested freestanding concepts, every composition declaring its `## Composes` edges, every standard explicitly anchored. The clean intent graph is the achievement; reading a taxonomy off it is trivial. This is the same shape as the conformance work (the oracle was already in the Generation-acceptance prose) and the RECIPE generator (derived from code): the library keeps finding that its hard-won *canonical substrate* makes downstream derivations fall out for free.

Two corollaries, stated because they bound the claim:

- **Derive over intent, never behavior.** The derivation is rigorous because it reads *declared intent* — the composition graph, reviewed and stable. Reading the same classification off *runtime behavior* (logs, traces, what systems actually do) is a different and far noisier problem — inference, not projection — and it forfeits the trustworthiness the intent substrate provides.
- **Not every axis derives.** Usage-facts (regulated, security, standards) the graph holds; intrinsic judgments (domain) it does not. Letting the intrinsic axis be free-authored rebuilds the committee taxonomy the whole move was escaping. The discipline: derive the usage-facts, gate the irreducible by an existing test (EOS decomposition), never free-author.

**Where this points (implication, not finding).** At organizational scale this is the shape of a *computed* rather than *maintained* ontology — and the dream level now has a name-holder, the **Intent** vocabulary:

| Layer | Preferred term | Full / optional form | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Overall system | **Intent Graph** | (Semantic) Intent Graph | The canonical ground truth. |
| Primitives | **Intent Atoms** | (Semantic) Intent Atoms (concepts) | This library's *atoms*; supersedes the earlier "Intent Atomic." |
| Assemblies | **Intent Compositions** | (Semantic) Intent Compositions | This library's *compositions*. |
| Derived views / filters | **Intent Lens** | (Semantic) Intent Lens | A labeled projection over the graph; singular for the concept. |

The Intent Graph is authority; every Lens is a labeled projection over it — "regulated-scope," "customer-facing," "audit-relevant" as lenses rather than folders ("HIPAA *via* audit-trail," never "regulated: true"). What today demonstrated is the existence proof on a deliberately small, clean Intent Graph. The distance to the org-scale version is *entirely* the substrate discipline — whether Grace-Commons-grade structured intent with explicit composition edges can be imposed across an organization's real artifacts — a people-and-process problem, not a generator. The distinction this file exists to hold: the computed *taxonomy* is the demonstrated result; the computed *organizational Intent Graph* is where it points, gated on a substrate nobody has yet built at scale.
