---- MODULE party-identity ----
\* Grace Commons — Party Identity atom.
\* Spec-level formal sibling of atoms/party-identity.md.
\* Derived validator; the English spec is the single source of truth. If this
\* model and the English disagree, diagnose per pressure-testing.md section The conflict
\* protocol before changing either.
\*
\* WHAT THIS MODEL CHECKS
\* The load-bearing claim of the atom is Invariant 4: a party in Verified state
\* has at least one `passed` verification recorded AFTER the most recent suspend,
\* in INSERTION ORDER (or, if never suspended, since enroll). This is an
\* ordering-across-action-sequences property — exactly the class three-pass
\* English review cannot exhaust but TLC checks under every interleaving.
\*
\* MODELING CHOICES
\* - One party. Invariant 4 is an intra-party ordering property; concurrency
\*   ACROSS parties does not bear on it, so a single party exercises the claim
\*   while keeping the state space finite.
\* - The party's event stream (verification events + state-change suspends, etc.)
\*   is modeled as an insertion-ordered log: a function 1..MaxEvents -> Event,
\*   with `len` filled slots. The Sequences module is avoided deliberately — the
\*   repo's WASM checker (tla-checker) handles Naturals/FiniteSets/functions; the
\*   existing composition models use the same restraint.
\* - Invariant 4 is DERIVED from the log (HasPassedAfterSuspend below), not
\*   tracked as a flag updated by the same rule as the reinstate guard. That
\*   keeps the check honest: the invariant is evaluated against the actual
\*   insertion-ordered history, so the buggy twin genuinely produces a violating
\*   log rather than a flag that was never set.
\*
\* NOT MODELED (out of scope for the load-bearing property)
\* - Field-format validation (invalid-request) and storage-failure rejections —
\*   these are pre-write guards, not ordering claims.
\* - Atomicity of multi-record writes (Invariant 11) — a within-action property,
\*   not an interleaving-of-actions property.
\* - Multiple parties and id uniqueness (Invariants 9, 10) — structural, not
\*   ordering; Alloy's bounded-structural surface is the right tool, not TLC.

EXTENDS Naturals, FiniteSets

CONSTANT MaxEvents          \* bound on the event-log length (keeps TLC finite)

\* Event alphabet recorded in the insertion-ordered log:
\*   vp = verify(passed)   vf = verify(failed)
\*   sus = suspend         rei = reinstate        cls = close
\* "e" marks an unfilled log slot.

    len,                    \* number of filled log slots
    everClosed              \* history flag: has close ever fired (for Inv 3)

\* A `passed` verification with no suspend after it == a passed verification
\* after the MOST RECENT suspend, in insertion order. Derived from the log.

\* CORRECT reinstate: guarded on a passed verification after the most recent
\* suspend. This is the atom's direct enforcement of Invariant 4.

\* Invariant 3 — Closed is absorbing (history-flag form).

\* Invariant 6 — append-only in insertion order. Promoted from a by-construction
\* assumption to an explicit check (2026-06-03 coverage cross-check): the log is a
\* contiguous filled prefix — every position <= len holds a real event, every
\* position > len is empty. A malformed append (a hole, or a write past the tail)
\* violates this; append-only/monotonic growth is the structural consequence.
