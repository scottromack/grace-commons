-- medication-order.als
-- Alloy structural model for the Grace Commons Medication Order atom
-- (atoms/medication-order.md)
--
-- PURPOSE
-- Verify the load-bearing structural invariants of the Medication Order atom
-- by bounded exhaustive search. The model encodes:
--   (a) amendment-chain linearity (Invariant 4), and
--   (b) the pre-dispensing amendment guard (Invariant 3),
-- as its primary target claims.
--
-- INVARIANTS ENCODED
--   Invariant 3 — Amendment is pre-dispensing only. An order may acquire a
--                 successor (i.e. be amended) only while in a pre-dispensing
--                 state (Ordered or Verified). Orders in Dispensed, Administered,
--                 Completed, Cancelled, or Discontinued state must not have a
--                 successor. Amended and On Hold are excluded by the state
--                 consistency facts below (Amended has a successor by definition;
--                 On Hold orders carry a prior_state guard at the action layer —
--                 not the structural layer, so On Hold is also excluded from
--                 having a successor here, since the spec says amend rejects
--                 on-hold orders with "on-hold" and only valid source states for
--                 amend are Ordered or Verified).
--   Invariant 4 — Amendment chains are linear. Each order has at most one
--                 successor_id and at most one predecessor_id. Chains are
--                 singly-linked; branching and cycles are forbidden.
--   Invariant 2 — Successor inherits identity fields. The successor carries the
--                 same patient_ref, prescriber_ref, and medication_ref as the
--                 original. (Spec section Identity model and section Invariants 2/4.)
--
-- SCOPE
-- Static structural model (snapshots). Each Order sig represents one medication
-- order record in the store. The amendment chain is modeled as a directed relation
-- (successor) over the set of orders. States are encoded as an abstract sig with
-- named singletons. The pre-dispensing guard is modeled as a structural fact:
-- an order has a successor iff it is in Amended state, and Amended state is only
-- reachable from pre-dispensing states (Ordered or Verified) — making the post-
-- dispensing-no-successor invariant a structural consequence verifiable by check.
--
-- NOT MODELED HERE
-- - Clock semantics / ordered_at / verified_at / dispensed_at (not needed to
--   verify chain linearity or the dispensing boundary)
-- - Hold/reinstate mechanics (Invariants 5, 9) — covered by medication-order.tla
-- - Cryptographic tamper-evidence (composing-pattern concern)
-- - Access control / permission checks (composing-pattern concern)
-- - Field validation (non-whitespace constraints) — Invariants 10, 11
-- - Storage-failure atomicity (implementation obligation, not structural invariant)
-- - Multi-store-instance routing (deployment concern)
-- - Value constraints on dose / dose_unit / route / frequency (deployment policy)
--
-- HOW TO READ THE RESULTS
-- Every "check A_*" should return UNSAT — "No counterexample found" — meaning the
-- asserted guarantee holds for all configurations within the scope.
-- Every "run Show*" should return SAT — at least one instance exists — confirming
-- the configuration space is non-empty (invariants are satisfiable; no fact
-- over-constrains).
-- A "check" that returns SAT (counterexample found) is a spec finding.
-- A "run" that returns UNSAT (no instance) means the facts are too restrictive.
--
-- HARNESS COMMANDS (from tools/harness):
--   node check.mjs ../../atoms/medication-order.als
--   Expected: PASS (all checks UNSAT, all runs SAT)

-- Invariant 4 (no-merging half): no two distinct orders share the same successor.

-- closes the loop: Amended state is only reachable from Ordered or Verified.
-- Structurally: if an order is Amended, then its predecessor (the order that was
-- amended) was in a pre-dispensing state *at the moment of amendment*.
-- In a static snapshot model the predecessor's current state IS Amended; to
-- capture the pre-dispensing guard structurally we assert the inverse:
-- orders in post-dispensing / terminal / inactive states must have no successor.
-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

-- Invariant 3 (core structural form): orders that have passed the dispensing
-- boundary — or were cancelled, discontinued, or put on hold — cannot be amended.
-- This is the structural invariant: no order in a NoSuccessorState has a successor.

    all x : Order | x.state in NoSuccessorState implies no x.successor
}

-- Successor state constraint: a successor order (one with a predecessor) always
-- starts in Ordered state. Spec section Actions section amend: "The successor starts in Ordered
-- state regardless of whether the original was Ordered or Verified."
