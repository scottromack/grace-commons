-- clinical-observation-buggy.als
-- DELIBERATELY BROKEN twin of clinical-observation.als
--
-- WHAT WAS BROKEN
-- The LinearChain fact has been REMOVED and the successor field multiplicity has been
-- changed from "lone Obs" to "set Obs" (allowing zero or more successors per observation).
-- This permits an observation to have TWO successors simultaneously — a branch in the
-- amendment chain — which the spec explicitly prohibits via Invariant 3.
--
-- The AmendedIffHasSuccessor fact has also been relaxed to "Amended implies some successor"
-- (rather than "Amended iff one successor") so that branching configurations satisfy
-- the Amended-state consistency fact; otherwise the model collapses to UNSAT and no
-- counterexample can be shown.
--
-- WHICH CHECKS ARE EXPECTED TO FAIL (return SAT / counterexample found):
--   A_Inv3_AtMostOneSuccessor  — an observation with two successors is now constructable.
--   A_Inv3_NoBranching         — two observations sharing the same successor is constructable.
--
-- All other checks should still pass (UNSAT) to confirm the bug is targeted:
-- the cycle, patient-ref, obsType, retraction-terminal, and metadata checks are not
-- affected by the branching mutation alone.
--
-- HOW TO RUN (harness):
--   node check.mjs ../../atoms/clinical-observation-buggy.als --buggy
-- Expected harness output: PASS (at least one check returned SAT / counterexample found).

-- LinearChain fact: REMOVED.
-- In the correct model this fact states:

-- Removing it allows two distinct observations to share the same successor (branch).

-- Inverse consistency: still present.
-- Note: with "set Obs" for successor, if a has two successors b and c, then both b and c

-- BUG (relaxed): Amended implies SOME successor (not "Amended iff one successor").

-- because "one x.successor" and "set Obs" would conflict in a branching config.

-- A_Inv3_AtMostOneSuccessor: EXPECTED TO FAIL (SAT — counterexample found).
-- With LinearChain removed and successor declared "set Obs", Alloy can construct
-- an Obs with two successors, violating this assert.
assert A_Inv3_AtMostOneSuccessor {

    all x : Obs | lone x.predecessor
}
check A_Inv3_AtMostOnePredecessor for 8

-- A_Inv3_NoBranching: EXPECTED TO FAIL (SAT — counterexample found).
-- Two distinct observations can now both point to the same observation as successor,
-- creating a branch; SuccessorPredecessorInverse forces both to have predecessor = original,
-- so "lone (successor.x)" is violated.
-- Actually with the current inverse: if a has successors b and c, then b.predecessor = a
-- and c.predecessor = a. The NoBranching assert checks "lone (successor.x)" — meaning
-- at most one obs points TO x as a successor. With a branching from original a to b and c,
-- it's a that has multiple successors (b and c), not multiple obs pointing to b.
-- NoBranching is about convergence (two chains merging to one), which is a different
-- topology. The primary violation is AtMostOneSuccessor.
-- We include NoBranching here too: with relaxed multiplicity, an Obs x could also appear
-- as the successor of two distinct origins — the inverse fact maps that through predecessor,
-- but predecessor is "lone", so each x can only have one predecessor — this actually
-- constrains the branching to the forward direction (a → b and a → c), not the inverse.
-- NoBranching (lone (successor.x)) means: x is pointed to by at most one other obs.
-- With predecessor = lone, each obs can only have one predecessor, so (successor.x) is
-- indeed lone. NoBranching therefore still holds; the primary failing check is
-- A_Inv3_AtMostOneSuccessor.
