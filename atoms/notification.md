## Summary

Notification records whether a single piece of information actually reached a single recipient. Where Subscription records who wants to know about a class of events, Notification records the outcome of one delivery. It creates a permanent, unchangeable record of a delivery attempt and tracks it to one of three end states: [Delivered] (the transport layer confirmed receipt), [Failed] (the transport returned a definite error), or [Expired] (the delivery window ran out with no recorded outcome). These are kept as three distinct states because each answers a different question and is handled by a different part of the system — the delivery layer, the failure handler, the expiry scheduler. The pattern does not decide who should be notified or how to reach them; by the time it is asked to create a record, the recipient and the content are already settled. Nothing is ever deleted, so the full delivery history of any notification is always recoverable. This is what underlies delivery audit trails in regulated settings, and it is the substrate for retry logic, which records each retry as a new notification rather than altering the failed one.

---

## Intent

When an event fires against a subscription, something must carry the resulting information to the recipient and record whether it arrived. That record is the notification: a durable account of the delivery attempt with enough state to answer the operational questions — *did the recipient get this? was delivery attempted and failed? did this expire before it could be delivered?*

Notification records *delivery*. It does not know about subscriptions, events, or routing; those belong to the composing Notification Fanout pattern. What the atom owns is the delivery record for a single recipient from the moment of creation through its terminal outcome: Delivered, Failed, or Expired.

The three terminal states are distinct because they answer different questions. Delivered: *did the recipient receive it?* Failed: *was delivery attempted and did the attempt not succeed?* Expired: *did this sit undelivered beyond the allowed window without a recorded failure?* Collapsing them into a single terminal state would hide information that operators, auditors, and retry logic each need separately.

This is a freestanding (can be specified without naming any other pattern) atom in the EOS (Essence of Software — Daniel Jackson's framework for specifying software concepts as freestanding, composable units) sense. It has its own state (the notification set), its own actions (`create`, `deliver`, `fail`, `expire`, `status_of`, `pending_for`), and its own operational principles (notifications are immutable once recorded; terminal states are irreversible; `status_of` and `pending_for` are read-only queries). It does not implement routing, subscription evaluation, retry scheduling, or delivery transport. Each is a separate composable pattern; see Composition notes.

## Structure

### Identity model

Every notification known to the system has a **[Notification Id]** — an opaque, immutable, host-allocated at the I/O seam (injected into the transition, not generated inside it) identifier produced by [Create]. The id is the notification's identity; the recipient reference and payload are immutable *properties* of the notification, not its identity.

The opaque-id model follows the same discipline used across the library. Identifying a notification by ([Recipient Ref], [Payload]) would collapse independently-created notifications into a single record — a recipient may be notified of the same event scope multiple times (e.g., after re-subscribing), and each delivery attempt is a distinct record with its own outcome. Opaque ids preserve one-notification-one-id discipline.

Ids are not reused after a notification reaches a terminal state.

### Inputs

- A recipient reference identifying *who* the notification is addressed to. Opaque — the actor registry is a separate concept. The atom requires only that recipient references support equality testing (so [Pending For] and [Status Of] queries can filter and look up by recipient); it does not parse, normalize, or otherwise interpret their contents.
- A payload carrying *what* is being communicated. Opaque — the composing system defines payload structure and content. This atom stores and returns the payload unchanged; it does not inspect, parse, or validate its contents.
- Actions:
  - [Create] — (Projected contract: `create(recipient_ref, payload) → notification_id | rejected(reason)`)
  - [Deliver] — (Projected contract: `deliver(notification_id) → ok | rejected(reason)`)
  - [Fail] — (Projected contract: `fail(notification_id) → ok | rejected(reason)`)
  - [Expire] — (Projected contract: `expire(notification_id) → ok | rejected(reason)`)
  - [Status Of] — (Projected contract: `status_of(notification_id) → {notification_id, recipient_ref, payload, created_at, status, delivered_at?, failed_at?, expired_at?} | not-known`)
  - [Pending For] — (Projected contract: `pending_for(recipient_ref) → [notification_id, ...]`)
- A clock providing wall-time timestamps, and an id source for [Notification Id] allocation — both injected at the atom's single I/O seam. Per the Logic Confinement Principle (see [`execution-contract.md`](../execution-contract.md)), the host reads the clock and allocates the [Notification Id] at the seam, *before* the transition runs; the pure transition receives the timestamps and [Notification Id] as injected inputs. Neither is read or generated inside the core transition, and neither is supplied by the business caller — which keeps the transition deterministic and forecloses caller-supplied timestamp or id lying.

**String input policy (applies to [Recipient Ref] and [Payload]).** Values are treated byte-exact: no trimming, no Unicode normalization, no case folding is applied before storage or comparison. A whitespace-only string counts as empty for the presence check and is rejected wherever non-empty is required (i.e., [Recipient Ref]). The deployment sets a maximum length per string input; a value exceeding it is rejected as [Invalid Request]. Callers own canonicalization — two [Recipient Ref] values differing only in case or normalization form are two distinct recipients to this atom.

### Outputs

- The current set of notifications ([Pending], [Delivered], [Failed], and [Expired]).
- For each notification: [Notification Id], [Recipient Ref], [Payload], [Created At], [Status], and the applicable terminal timestamp ([Delivered At], [Failed At], or [Expired At]).
- [Create] returns the new [Notification Id] on success, or a rejection naming the failed precondition.
- [Deliver], [Fail], and [Expire] return `ok` on success, or a rejection naming the failed precondition.
- [Status Of] returns one of two first-class outcomes: the full notification record (all stored fields for that id), or [Not Known] if no notification exists for the given id. Both are answers to the query, not success-failure pairs.
- [Pending For] returns the list of [Notification Id] values for all [Pending] notifications addressed to the queried recipient. The list is unordered. Composing systems that require delivery in creation order must sort by [Created At] on the returned ids.

### State

A notification occupies one of four named states:

- **[Pending]** — the notification has been created and delivery has not yet been confirmed, failed, or expired.
- **[Delivered]** — the notification reached the recipient. Terminal.
- **[Failed]** — delivery was attempted and did not succeed. Terminal.
- **[Expired]** — the notification was not delivered and no failure was recorded within the allowed window. Terminal.

Each notification carries:

- **[Notification Id]** — opaque, immutable, host-allocated at the I/O seam (injected into the transition, not generated inside it). Set on [Create]. Never changes.
- **[Recipient Ref]** — opaque reference to the intended recipient. Set on [Create]. Never changes.
- **[Payload]** — opaque content of the notification. Set on [Create]. Never changes.
- **[Created At]** — wall-time when the notification was created. Set on [Create]. Never changes.
- **[Status]** — `pending`, `delivered`, `failed`, or `expired`. Set to `pending` on [Create]; transitions to a terminal state on the corresponding action.
- **[Delivered At]** — wall-time when delivery was confirmed. Absent unless status is `delivered`; set on [Deliver]. Never changes after set.
- **[Failed At]** — wall-time when the failure was recorded. Absent unless status is `failed`; set on [Fail]. Never changes after set.
- **[Expired At]** — wall-time when the expiry was recorded. Absent unless status is `expired`; set on [Expire]. Never changes after set.

Transitions — writes stamp their timestamp from the injected clock; the two queries below the rule cause no transition. State is unchanged on any rejection, and each terminal transition is serialized per [Notification Id] (Decision points):

| action | from | to | stamps | result | rejections |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Create] | *(none)* | **[Pending]** | fresh [Notification Id]; [Recipient Ref]; [Payload]; [Created At] | the new [Notification Id] | [Invalid Request] |
| [Deliver] | [Pending] | **[Delivered]** | [Delivered At] | `ok` | [Not Known]; [Not Pending] |
| [Fail] | [Pending] | **[Failed]** | [Failed At] | `ok` | [Not Known]; [Not Pending] |
| [Expire] | [Pending] | **[Expired]** | [Expired At] | `ok` | [Not Known]; [Not Pending] |
| [Status Of] | read-only | — | — | the full record, or [Not Known] | — |
| [Pending For] | read-only | — | — | the [Pending] ids for the recipient | — |

The three terminal transitions ([Deliver], [Fail], [Expire]) share identical preconditions: the [Notification Id] must be known (else [Not Known]) and the notification must be in [Pending] (else [Not Pending]). [Status Of] returns the full notification record for the given id, or [Not Known]; [Pending For] returns the [Notification Id] values for all [Pending] notifications where `notification.recipient_ref = recipient_ref`.

### Flow

1. **An event fires; the composing pattern creates a notification.** The Notification Fanout pattern (or equivalent) calls `create(recipient_ref, payload)` — the atom records the notification in [Pending] and returns the id.
2. **The delivery layer attempts to deliver (optional).** The transport mechanism (webhook call, WebSocket push, email send) attempts to reach the recipient. This step may be skipped entirely — a notification may be expired before any delivery attempt begins if the deadline passes first.
3. **Delivery outcome is recorded.** Exactly one of three transitions applies:
   - 3a. Transport succeeds: `deliver(notification_id)` → [Delivered], [Delivered At] set.
   - 3b. Transport fails: `fail(notification_id)` → [Failed], [Failed At] set.
   - 3c. Deadline passes without a delivery attempt, or without a recorded outcome: `expire(notification_id)` → [Expired], [Expired At] set. Step 2 need not have occurred.
4. **Operators or retry logic consult notification state.** `pending_for(recipient_ref)` returns unresolved notifications; `status_of(notification_id)` returns the full record for any notification by id, including terminal ones.

### Decision points

- **At `create(recipient_ref, payload)`** — [Recipient Ref] must be non-empty — specifically, not null, undefined, the empty string, or whitespace-only (per the String input policy); otherwise [Invalid Request]. The atom does not parse or interpret the opaque value beyond this presence check. [Payload] must be present — null or absent is rejected as [Invalid Request]; any non-null payload, including an empty string or empty object, is accepted. The atom does not inspect, validate, or parse payload content. There is no uniqueness constraint: multiple notifications may be created for the same recipient with the same payload — each is a distinct delivery attempt with its own id and outcome.
- **At `deliver(notification_id)`** — [Notification Id] must reference a known notification; otherwise [Not Known]. The notification must be in [Pending]; transitioning a non-[Pending] notification is rejected as [Not Pending].
- **At `fail(notification_id)`** — same preconditions as [Deliver]: [Not Known] or [Not Pending].
- **At `expire(notification_id)`** — same preconditions: [Not Known] or [Not Pending].
- **At `status_of(notification_id)`** — no precondition. Empty or malformed [Notification Id] returns [Not Known] — no notification has an empty id, so the result is structurally [Not Known]. Both [Not Known] and the full record are first-class outcomes; neither is a rejection.
- **At `pending_for(recipient_ref)`** — no precondition. Empty or malformed [Recipient Ref] returns an empty list — no notification has an empty recipient, so the result is structurally empty. Returns an empty list if no [Pending] notifications exist for the recipient. The query is read-only.

**Single-record transition serialization is the load-bearing precondition for status monotonicity (Invariant 2) and terminal exclusivity (Invariant 3).** Each terminal transition ([Deliver], [Fail], [Expire]) must execute as an atomic, serialized unit per [Notification Id]; without this guarantee, two concurrent transitions could both observe [Pending] and both proceed, producing two terminal timestamps and violating both invariants. The host environment supplies this serialization; the atom specifies the requirement.

### Behavior

Observed behavior, derived from how notification delivery systems are actually deployed:

- The three terminal transitions ([Deliver], [Fail], [Expire]) are separate actions rather than a single `resolve(notification_id, outcome)` action. The likely objection: "they share identical preconditions and return shapes; a parameterized action would reduce duplication." The mechanism: keeping them separate preserves distinct action semantics — the delivery layer, failure handler, and expiry scheduler are independent actors with independent authorization surfaces; a parameterized outcome enum would introduce a new precondition (is the enum value valid?) that currently does not exist. The result: each terminal transition is an unambiguously-named operation with no shared enum validation burden.
- The three terminal states are mutually exclusive. A notification transitions from [Pending] to exactly one terminal state. Once terminal, no further transition is possible; [Deliver], [Fail], or [Expire] called on a non-[Pending] notification returns [Not Pending].
- **[Fail] vs. [Expire] — a deployment policy.** [Failed] indicates an explicit delivery attempt that produced a definitive negative outcome (HTTP 5xx response, bounced email, invalid token, connection refused). [Expired] indicates that the allowed window elapsed without either a successful delivery or a recorded failure. Whether a connection timeout is [Fail] or [Expire] is the composing system's call; the atom only records the outcome, not how it was determined.
- Concurrent [Deliver], [Fail], or [Expire] calls for the same [Notification Id] resolve serially under the host environment's serialization guarantees. The first transition wins; subsequent calls receive [Not Pending].
- Who calls [Deliver], [Fail], or [Expire] is handled at the deployment layer. In a push model, the delivery layer calls these after attempting to push. In a pull model, the host system calls [Deliver] when the recipient reads the notification. In a scheduled-expiry model, a background process calls [Expire] for notifications past their deadline. The atom records the transition; the caller is the composing system's responsibility.
- The atom does not enforce who may call [Create] — any caller may create a notification for any recipient. Authorization to create belongs to the composing system.
- Multiple [Pending] notifications for the same recipient are allowed and independent. Each has its own id, payload, and delivery lifecycle. [Pending For] returns all of them; the composing system decides the delivery order.
- No notification is deleted. All terminal records — [Delivered], [Failed], [Expired] — remain in the store for audit and operational purposes. [Pending For] excludes them; `status_of(notification_id)` returns them.
- A [Failed] notification does not automatically trigger a retry. If retry is desired, the composing system creates a new notification record for the retry attempt — a distinct record with a distinct id and its own outcome (see Edge cases).
- [Payload] is stored and returned opaque. The atom does not parse, validate, or act on payload content. Whether the payload is a JSON object, a plain string, or a reference to another record is defined entirely by the composing system.
- [Status Of] is a read-only query with no side effects. It returns all stored fields — including the opaque payload — for any notification in any state: [Pending], [Delivered], [Failed], or [Expired]. No notification becomes inaccessible via [Status Of] after reaching a terminal state; the record is durable for the lifetime of the system.
- Time and [Notification Id] are injected at the I/O seam: the host reads the clock and allocates [Notification Id] before the transition runs; the core transition receives both as inputs and neither reads a clock nor mints an id. Caller signatures (`create(recipient_ref, payload)` and all other actions) are unchanged — timestamps and ids are never caller-supplied.
- A notification may remain in [Pending] indefinitely. The atom does not impose a maximum lifetime; whether and when a [Pending] notification reaches a terminal state depends on the composing system's delivery layer and any scheduled-expiry process. A store with long-lived [Pending] records is not a spec violation — composing systems that need bounded [Pending] lifetimes wire a scheduled-expiry process that calls [Expire] at deadline.

### Feedback

Each successful action produces an observable, measurable change:

- After [Create] — a new notification appears in [Pending] with a fresh [Notification Id], the supplied [Recipient Ref] and [Payload], and [Created At]. Total notification count increases by one. Pending count increases by one. The id is returned. Falsifiable: after `create(r, p) → n`, `status_of(n)` must return a record with `status = pending` and `recipient_ref = r`.
- After [Deliver] — the notification moves to [Delivered] with [Delivered At]. Pending count decreases by one; delivered count increases by one; total count unchanged. Falsifiable: `status_of(n)` must return `status = delivered` and `delivered_at` must be set; `pending_for(recipient_ref)` must not include `n`.
- After [Fail] — the notification moves to [Failed] with [Failed At]. Pending count decreases; failed count increases. Falsifiable: `status_of(n)` must return `status = failed` and `failed_at` set.
- After [Expire] — the notification moves to [Expired] with [Expired At]. Pending count decreases; expired count increases. Falsifiable: `status_of(n)` must return `status = expired` and `expired_at` set.
- After [Status Of] — no state change. Returns the full notification record or [Not Known].
- After [Pending For] — no state change. Returns the list of [Notification Id]s in [Pending] state for the queried recipient.

[Create] rejections: [Invalid Request]. [Deliver], [Fail], [Expire] rejections: [Not Known], [Not Pending].

The full notification set — [Pending], [Delivered], [Failed], [Expired] — is queryable via [Status Of] and [Pending For].

### Invariants

The following hold across all valid sequences of actions and constitute the verification surface of the pattern:

- **Invariant 1 — Notification immutability.** Once recorded, a notification's [Notification Id], [Recipient Ref], [Payload], and [Created At] never change. Once set, [Delivered At], [Failed At], and [Expired At] never change. No field in the notification record is ever overwritten.
- **Invariant 2 — Status monotonicity.** A notification's status transitions only from [Pending] to one terminal state: [Delivered], [Failed], or [Expired]. No notification returns from a terminal state to [Pending] or transitions between terminal states.
- **Invariant 3 — Terminal states are exclusive.** At most one of [Delivered At], [Failed At], [Expired At] is present for any notification. A notification in [Delivered] has [Delivered At] and no other terminal timestamp; likewise for [Failed] and [Expired]. A [Pending] notification has none.
- **Invariant 4 — Terminal timestamps match status.** [Delivered At] is present if and only if status is `delivered`. [Failed At] is present if and only if status is `failed`. [Expired At] is present if and only if status is `expired`.
- **Invariant 5 — Id stability.** A notification's [Notification Id] is set on [Create] and never changes.
- **Invariant 6 — No id reuse.** No two notifications share a [Notification Id] across the lifetime of the system.
- **Invariant 7 — Pending query excludes terminals.** `pending_for(recipient_ref)` returns only notifications in [Pending] state for the queried recipient. [Delivered], [Failed], and [Expired] notifications are not included regardless of their [Recipient Ref].
- **Invariant 8 — Timestamp ordering.** For any notification in [Delivered] state, [Created At] ≤ [Delivered At]. For any notification in [Failed] state, [Created At] ≤ [Failed At]. For any notification in [Expired] state, [Created At] ≤ [Expired At]. This invariant is best-effort under non-monotonic clocks; if the underlying clock moves backward between [Create] and the terminal action, the inequality may be violated. The implementor is responsible for the clock discipline that makes each inequality hold; see Edge cases.

- **Invariant 9 — Notification durability.** Notifications are never deleted from the store. Once created, a notification record persists through all state transitions and remains queryable via [Status Of] for the lifetime of the system. The total notification count is monotonically non-decreasing.

Notification immutability and durability together give the *auditability* property — the full delivery history of every notification is recoverable from the notification store alone, with no gaps. Terminal-state exclusivity and timestamp matching (Invariants 3 and 4) give the *unambiguous record* property — for any notification, exactly one delivery outcome is recorded and its timestamp is stable. Status monotonicity and timestamp ordering together give the *operational readability* property — [Pending For] is a deterministic snapshot of unresolved deliveries at query time.

## Examples

The same atom, three domains, identical mechanic.

### Shared Todo — assignment notification delivery

A Notification Fanout pattern creates a notification when a task is assigned: `create(dev_d, {type: "task:assigned", task_id: t1, assigned_by: manager_m}) → notif_77`. The WebSocket layer pushes the payload to dev_d's active session and calls `deliver(notif_77)` → [Delivered]. `status_of(notif_77)` returns `status = delivered`, [Delivered At] set. `pending_for(dev_d)` returns `[]`.

If dev_d is offline, the push attempt produces a connection error: `fail(notif_77)` → [Failed]. The composing system may create a retry notification: `create(dev_d, {same payload}) → notif_78` — a new [Pending] record, distinct id, independent outcome.

If neither delivery nor failure is recorded within the expiry window: `expire(notif_77)` → [Expired]. `status_of(notif_77)` returns [Expired At].

### Support queue — escalation alert

When queue 9 escalates, the fanout pattern creates one notification per subscribed supervisor: `create(supervisor_s, {type: "escalation", queue: 9, ticket: t22}) → notif_33`. Email delivery succeeds: `deliver(notif_33)` → [Delivered]. `status_of(notif_33)` returns `status = delivered`, [Delivered At]. Elapsed delivery time is `delivered_at − created_at`.

Supervisor_s later asks *"was I notified about the queue-9 escalation?"* — `pending_for(supervisor_s)` returns an empty list (nothing pending), and `status_of(notif_33)` returns `status = delivered` with [Delivered At]. The delivery record answers the question from stored fields alone.

### Compliance system — policy change

An administrator broadcasts a policy update. Three compliance officers each receive a notification: `create(officer_a, {type: "policy:updated", policy_id: p7}) → notif_101`, similarly for officers b and c. Officer_a's email bounces: `fail(notif_101)`. Officers b and c are delivered successfully. `status_of(notif_101)` shows [Failed At]; `status_of(notif_102)` and `status_of(notif_103)` show [Delivered At]. An operator queries `pending_for` for each officer — empty for all three. The notification store shows: two [Delivered], one [Failed]; the composing system creates a retry for officer_a or escalates to a secondary channel.

### Rejection path — invalid create

A composing system attempts to create a notification with an empty recipient reference: `create(recipient_ref: "", payload: {type: "task:assigned", task_id: "t1"})` → `rejected(invalid-request)`. No [Notification Id] is issued; no record enters the store. The composing system must supply a non-empty recipient reference before the notification can be created.

### Regulated adversarial scenarios

Three scenarios the notification store must survive in regulated contexts:

- **Regulator audit — demonstrate all notifications for a compliance event.** A compliance auditor asks *"show all notifications created for the policy:updated event on 2025-03-14, and whether each was delivered."* The auditor queries the notification store for notifications where `created_at` falls on 2025-03-14 and the payload references the relevant policy. [Status Of] for each returned id shows the delivery outcome — [Delivered At], [Failed At], or [Expired At]. The notification store answers from stored fields alone; Invariants 1 and 3-4 guarantee the delivery record is complete and unambiguous.
- **Disputed delivery — actor claims they were not notified.** Officer_a claims they received no notification of policy update p7. The investigator queries the notification store for notifications where `recipient_ref = officer_a` and the payload references `policy_id: p7`. If a record exists with [Delivered At] set, Invariant 1 (notification immutability) is the structural answer: the notification was created with that recipient and delivery was confirmed at that time. If the record shows [Failed At] or [Expired At], the store confirms delivery was not completed and documents why. The notification store is the single source of truth; no external corroboration is required.
- **Breach investigation — identify Pending notifications that may have exposed payload data.** A security incident requires identifying all notifications that were [Pending] at the time of breach (2025-06-01T03:00Z) and may have carried sensitive payload data. The investigator queries for notifications where `created_at ≤ 2025-06-01T03:00Z` and either `status = pending` (still unresolved now) or the applicable terminal timestamp falls after 2025-06-01T03:00Z (meaning the notification was [Pending] during the breach window but has since resolved). The reconstruction logic mirrors the Subscription pattern: `created_at ≤ T` and (`status = pending` or `delivered_at > T` or `failed_at > T` or `expired_at > T`). [Status Of] for each candidate returns the current record; `created_at` confirms the exposure window. The notification store answers the exposure scope question from stored fields alone without recourse to logs or developer narration.

## Non-goals and edge cases

What this atom does not cover:

- **Routing and subscription evaluation.** This atom creates and tracks delivery records; it does not evaluate subscriptions or determine who should be notified. That belongs to a Notification Fanout composing pattern that wires Subscription + Notification + an event source.
- **Retry scheduling.** A [Failed] notification does not trigger a retry. The composing system creates a new notification record for the retry attempt: `create(recipient_ref, payload) → new_notification_id`. The retry is a distinct record with a distinct id and its own outcome. Both the original [Failed] record and the retry record are preserved in the store.
- **Transport mechanism.** Whether delivery is via WebSocket, webhook, email, push notification, in-app message, or SMS is handled at the deployment layer. The atom records the outcome ([Deliver], [Fail], [Expire]); the mechanism that produces that outcome is out of scope.
- **`fail` vs. `expire` boundary.** Whether a connection timeout, an invalid token, or a rate-limit response is [Fail] or [Expire] is a deployment policy the composing system defines. The atom only records which terminal transition was called; it does not inspect or validate the reason.
- **Delivery ordering guarantees.** Multiple [Pending] notifications for the same recipient may be delivered in any order. If delivery ordering matters, the composing system is responsible for imposing it. [Pending For] returns an unordered list; the composing system sorts by [Created At] if ordered delivery is required.
- **Recipient read confirmation vs. system delivery confirmation.** [Deliver] covers system-level confirmation that the transport layer accepted the notification. Deployments that additionally require read confirmation (the recipient explicitly acknowledged the notification) should create two separate notification records: one for the push attempt (resolved with [Deliver] or [Fail] at push time) and one for the read-acknowledgement (resolved with [Deliver] when the recipient acknowledges). The bare atom does not distinguish delivery from reading; the distinction requires two records.
- **Payload validation and schema.** Payload is opaque. Whether a payload is well-formed, type-safe, or complete is the composing system's responsibility before calling [Create].
- **Notification deduplication.** Multiple [Create] calls for the same ([Recipient Ref], [Payload]) pair produce multiple distinct [Pending] notifications. Composing systems that require at-most-once delivery for a given event should use Duplicate Prevention to guard the [Create] call.
- **Recipient registration and lifecycle.** [Recipient Ref] is opaque. Whether a recipient exists or has been deprovisioned belongs to Actor Registry.
- **Authorization to create.** The atom does not enforce who may call [Create]. Any caller may create a notification for any recipient. Authorization to create belongs to the composing system.
- **Bulk expiry.** There is no bulk-expire surface. Expiring all [Pending] notifications past a deadline requires querying [Pending For] for each recipient and calling `expire(notification_id)` for each eligible id.
- **Atomicity and crash semantics.** Each terminal transition changes two fields simultaneously: [Status] and one terminal timestamp. A crash mid-[Deliver] that sets [Delivered At] without updating [Status], or vice versa, violates Invariant 4 (terminal timestamps match status). The implementor is responsible for the transactional boundary that makes both fields change together. The spec does not define recovery semantics for partial writes.
- **Payload data retention.** The notification store retains payload data for every notification for the lifetime of the system (Invariant 9). If payloads contain sensitive data — PII, financial records, medical information — the composing system is responsible for the retention policy. Retention Window is the composing pattern that bounds how long records must be kept and when they may be purged. The bare atom does not implement payload expiry or redaction.
- **Clock semantics.** [Created At], [Delivered At], [Failed At], and [Expired At] are wall-time from the injected clock. Clock skew, NTP (Network Time Protocol) adjustments, and timezone handling are handled at the deployment layer. Invariant 8 is best-effort under non-monotonic clocks.

## Generation acceptance

The audit surface is the notification store inspected on its stored fields — distinct from and complementary to the action surface ([Create], [Deliver], [Fail], [Expire], [Status Of], [Pending For]). The action surface answers *what does the atom do at runtime?*; the audit surface answers *what does the atom commit to recording, queryable on stored fields?*. A derived implementation must produce a store that supports the audit-surface queries below, independent of whether the runtime action surface exposes them.

A derived implementation of Notification is *acceptable* — in the regulator-acceptance sense — when an external auditor, given the notification store, can do all of the following without recourse to source code, runbooks, or developer narration:

- **Enumerate every notification with its full delivery history.** [Notification Id], [Recipient Ref], [Payload], [Created At], [Status], and the applicable terminal timestamp are present and queryable for every notification ever created. No notification is missing from the store.
- **Reconstruct the delivery status of any notification at any past point in time.** Given a [Notification Id] and a timestamp, the auditor can determine what state the notification was in: if `created_at ≤ t` and no terminal timestamp is before `t`, the notification was [Pending] at `t`; if `delivered_at ≤ t`, it was [Delivered]; and so on. The reconstruction is exact with respect to stored timestamps (Invariants 1 and 4); the wall-clock truth of those timestamps is subject to Invariant 8's best-effort clock caveat. Under a clock that has moved backward, two stored timestamps may be misordered; the auditor's answer is still deterministic on stored fields, but may not reflect wall-clock truth.
- **Confirm terminal state exclusivity.** For every notification, at most one of [Delivered At], [Failed At], [Expired At] is present. The auditor can verify this directly from the notification store (Invariant 3).
- **Confirm terminal timestamps match status.** For every notification, the presence of a terminal timestamp matches the [Status] field exactly — no notification has `status = delivered` with `failed_at` set, or any other mismatch (Invariant 4).
- **Identify composing patterns active in this deployment.** Whether notification attribution (Actor Identity), event firing history (Event Log), deduplication (Duplicate Prevention), retention (Retention Window), and tamper-evidence on the notification store (Tamper Evidence) are wired in, and with what configuration. The deployment's **fail-vs-expire policy** must also be disclosed — which operational events the deployment maps to [Fail] (e.g., HTTP 5xx, bounced email, invalid token) versus [Expire] (e.g., elapsed delivery window without a recorded outcome). Without this disclosure, the same operational event may produce `failed_at` in one deployment and `expired_at` in another, and cross-deployment audit cannot interpret records uniformly.

This is the generator's contract: any code generated from this atom must produce a notification store and a query surface that pass the five checks above.

## Terms

The canonical concepts this spec refers to. Each `[Term]` marker in the prose above links to its card here. A card states what the concept *is*, in plain English, plus its **Kind** — one of four: **Type** (a thing or category), **Operation** (a behavior), **Member** (a value of an enumerated Type), or, for a named datum, **Field** (a datum a Type carries — *what does it carry?*) or **Parameter** (a value an Operation needs — *what does it need?*). A card also names the Type it is a **Member of** / **Field of**, the Operation it is a **Parameter of**, and its **Role** where the domain assigns one. A card carries one **Projects** line — the concept's single canonical lowering token, the one place the concrete name stays visible on the page — for every Field, Parameter, and pinned/wire Member. Everything else about casing (each target's snake / camel / pascal / const / wire form) is **derived** from that one token by [`tools/harness/term-adapter.mjs`](../tools/harness/term-adapter.mjs), never hand-written. *(annotation.md Terms registry; representational only — it changes no guarantee, invariant, or behavior of the atom above.)*

#### Create

The behavior that records a new delivery record. It assigns a fresh [Notification Id] (host-allocated at the seam), records [Recipient Ref], [Payload], and [Created At], and returns the [Notification Id] (or [Invalid Request]). The record enters [Pending].

Kind: Operation

#### Deliver

The behavior that records successful delivery, transitioning a [Pending] notification to terminal [Delivered] and stamping [Delivered At]. Rejected for an unknown id ([Not Known]) or a non-[Pending] notification ([Not Pending]).

Kind: Operation

#### Fail

The behavior that records a definitive delivery failure, transitioning a [Pending] notification to terminal [Failed] and stamping [Failed At]. Same preconditions as [Deliver].

Kind: Operation

#### Expire

The behavior that records lapse of the delivery window without an outcome, transitioning a [Pending] notification to terminal [Expired] and stamping [Expired At]. Same preconditions as [Deliver].

Kind: Operation

#### Status Of

The read-only query returning the full record for a [Notification Id] in any state, or [Not Known] if no notification has that id. Never transitions.

Kind: Operation

#### Pending For

The read-only query returning the [Notification Id] values of all [Pending] notifications addressed to a [Recipient Ref] (unordered; excludes terminals, Invariant 7). Never transitions.

Kind: Operation

#### Notification Id

The opaque, immutable identity of a notification — host-allocated at the I/O seam (the injected id), produced by [Create], never reused (Invariant 6). The recipient and payload are properties of the notification, not its identity.

Kind:     Field
Field of: the notification record
Projects: notification_id

#### Recipient Ref

The opaque reference to the intended recipient. Set on [Create], immutable. Equality is byte-exact (no normalization); [Pending For] filters on it.

Kind:     Field
Field of: the notification record
Projects: recipient_ref

#### Payload

The opaque content of the notification. Set on [Create], immutable, stored and returned unchanged — never parsed, validated, or interpreted by the atom.

Kind:     Field
Field of: the notification record
Projects: payload

#### Created At

The wall-time the notification was created, stamped from the injected clock at [Create]. Immutable (Invariant 1). The lower bound for any terminal timestamp (Invariant 8).

Kind:     Field
Field of: the notification record
Projects: created_at

#### Status

The notification's lifecycle state — [Pending], [Delivered], [Failed], or [Expired]. Set to [Pending] on [Create]; transitions once to a terminal (Invariant 2).

Kind:     Field
Field of: the notification record
Projects: status

#### Delivered At

The wall-time delivery was confirmed, stamped at [Deliver]. Present iff status is [Delivered] (Invariants 3 and 4); immutable once set.

Kind:     Field
Field of: the notification record
Projects: delivered_at

#### Failed At

The wall-time the failure was recorded, stamped at [Fail]. Present iff status is [Failed] (Invariants 3 and 4); immutable once set.

Kind:     Field
Field of: the notification record
Projects: failed_at

#### Expired At

The wall-time the expiry was recorded, stamped at [Expire]. Present iff status is [Expired] (Invariants 3 and 4); immutable once set.

Kind:     Field
Field of: the notification record
Projects: expired_at

#### Pending

The non-terminal state of a created notification whose delivery has not been confirmed, failed, or expired. May transition to exactly one terminal; [Pending For] returns only records in this state.

Kind:      Member
Member of: the notification status
Role:      Outcome

#### Delivered

The terminal state of a notification that reached the recipient (transport confirmed). Carries [Delivered At]; absorbing (Invariant 2).

Kind:      Member
Member of: the notification status
Role:      Outcome

#### Failed

The terminal state of a notification whose delivery was attempted and produced a definitive negative outcome. Carries [Failed At]; absorbing.

Kind:      Member
Member of: the notification status
Role:      Outcome

#### Expired

The terminal state of a notification whose delivery window lapsed without a recorded outcome. Carries [Expired At]; absorbing.

Kind:      Member
Member of: the notification status
Role:      Outcome

#### Invalid Request

The refusal [Create] returns when request fields fail — an empty/whitespace [Recipient Ref], or a null/absent [Payload].

Kind:      Member
Member of: the Create rejection
Role:      Outcome
Projects:  invalid-request

#### Not Known

The refusal [Deliver], [Fail], or [Expire] returns when the [Notification Id] references no notification in the store. Also the [Status Of] outcome for an unknown id.

Kind:      Member
Member of: the action rejection
Role:      Outcome
Projects:  not-known

#### Not Pending

The refusal [Deliver], [Fail], or [Expire] returns when the target is not in [Pending] — i.e., already in a terminal state.

Kind:      Member
Member of: the action rejection
Role:      Outcome
Projects:  not-pending

## Composition notes

Notification is freestanding and is designed to compose with:

- **[Subscription](./subscription.md)** — the interest record that determines who should receive a notification. The composing Notification Fanout pattern calls `Subscription.subscribers_for(event_scope)` and then `Notification.create(subscriber_ref, payload)` for each result.
- **[Notification Fanout](../compositions/notification-fanout.md)** — the composition that wires Subscription + Notification + an event source into an end-to-end delivery pipeline. Notification Fanout is the composition that gives both atoms their operational meaning.
- **[Event Log](./event-log.md)** — records delivery attempts and outcomes as auditable events. Each [Deliver], [Fail], or [Expire] call can be appended to an Event Log for replay and investigation.
- **[Actor Identity](./actor-identity.md)** — records who triggered the creation of a notification when attribution of notification source is required.
- **[Retention Window](./retention-window.md)** — the notification store must be retained for the regulatory or operational lifetime the deployment requires.
- **[Tamper Evidence](./tamper-evidence.md)** — in regulated contexts, the notification store is a target for after-the-fact manipulation. Cryptographic commitment makes any rewrite detectable.
- **[Duplicate Prevention](./duplicate-prevention.md)** — composing systems that require at-most-once notification creation for a given event can use Duplicate Prevention to guard the [Create] call.

## Standards references

- **Observer pattern** (GoF) — Notification is the structured-natural-language realization of the notification object: the message delivered from subject to observer.
- **SMTP / RFC 5321** — SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, defined in the Internet standard RFC 5321) email delivery as the canonical push transport. The three terminal states map directly to SMTP disposition: 2xx success (Delivered), 5xx permanent failure (Failed), and timeout without delivery (Expired).
- **HTTP webhooks** — POST-to-URL delivery model standard in web systems. [Deliver] records a 2xx response; [Fail] records a 4xx/5xx or connection failure.
- **W3C Activity Streams 2.0** — semantic vocabulary for describing social and messaging events. Notification payloads in web deployments often conform to Activity Streams objects.
- **Apple Push Notification Service / Firebase Cloud Messaging** — platform push notification services where [Deliver] corresponds to accepted delivery and [Fail] corresponds to a rejected or unregistered token.
- **Daniel Jackson, *The Essence of Software*** — freestanding-atom posture; [Payload] as an opaque reference whose semantics are defined by the composing system.
- **Eiffel's design-by-contract** — preconditions on [Deliver], [Fail], and [Expire]; named rejection reasons.
