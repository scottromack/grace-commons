## Summary

Legal Hold is a formal instruction to keep a specific record intact — overriding any normal deletion schedule — until the legal matter that triggered it is resolved. When a lawsuit is anticipated, a regulator opens an investigation, or a team needs to freeze evidence, the normal "delete after N years" rule stops applying. The hold records the shift: who issued it, against which record, why, and under what authority. A hold is either [Active] (preservation in effect) or [Released] (lifted, permanently — it cannot be reactivated). Both placing and releasing are attributed, timestamped, and never altered afterward, so the full arc of any preservation obligation can be reconstructed from the records alone. Multiple holds can cover the same record independently — a record under both an internal investigation and a government investigation has two separate obligations, and releasing one leaves the other in force, which is exactly what multi-party legal situations require. The pattern does not itself block deletion; it records that an obligation exists, and the system that actually deletes records is responsible for checking for [Active] holds first. This is the mechanism behind litigation-hold management, breach-response preservation, and any setting where destroying a record during an active legal obligation exposes the organization to penalties.

## Intent

When litigation is reasonably anticipated, when a regulatory body opens an investigation, when an audit freeze is ordered, or when a breach response team needs to preserve forensic evidence, the normal retention clock stops being the governing rule. The obligation shifts from *keep this record for N years* to *keep this record until the legal matter resolves, regardless of what the retention schedule says*. That shift is a Legal Hold.

Legal Hold is the enforcement record for that shift. A compliance officer, legal counsel, or automated case management integration places a hold (a legally mandated preservation order — prevents deletion of records potentially relevant to litigation) on a record, naming who placed it, why, and under what legal authority. The record is now preserved. When the matter closes — the litigation settles, the investigation ends, the audit concludes — the hold is released. The record is again governed by its retention window. The full arc, from placement to release, is carried in the hold records themselves: every attribution field, every timestamp, every reason. The atom guarantees the chain is *present* and *immutable by specification*. Cryptographic protection of those records against post-hoc modification — the bar for court-admissible evidence in spoliation litigation (destruction or concealment of evidence relevant to a legal proceeding) — is added by composition with [Tamper Evidence](./tamper-evidence.md); this atom does not provide it alone.

The pattern is structurally distinct from [Retention Window](./retention-window.md) in a load-bearing way: Retention Window answers *how long must this record be kept under normal operation*; Legal Hold answers *this record may not be purged under any circumstances until this hold is explicitly released*. The two coexist as composing peers — a record under both a retention window and a legal hold must satisfy both: it cannot be purged before `retention_until`, and it cannot be purged while any Active hold remains. Neither atom enforces the other's constraint; the composition ([Regulated Record Retention & Defensible Deletion](../roadmap.md)) wires the gate that checks both before permitting purge. This keeps each atom freestanding.

The atom records holds; it does not prevent purge directly. Preventing purge is enforced by the composition that wires Legal Hold with the system's purge surface. This is deliberate: the atom specifies what a hold *is* and what its records must prove; the deployment decides which purge surfaces check for Active holds before acting. A Legal Hold atom that intercepts purge internally would need to know about storage layers, retention records, and purge mechanisms — absorbing concepts that belong to composing patterns and breaking freestanding status.

Multiple concurrent holds on the same record are structurally independent. This is not a simplification — it is the correct model for real multi-party legal situations. A record under both an internal forensic investigation hold and a state attorney general investigation hold has two independent preservation obligations. If the internal team closes its investigation and releases its hold, the AG's preservation obligation is unaffected. A system that released both holds when one was released would create spoliation risk. Each hold has its own `hold_id`, its own lifecycle, and its own release event. Whether a record is *currently held* — meaning at least one Active hold covers it — is a query result over the hold records, not a separate state on the hold.

This is a freestanding (can be specified without naming any other pattern) concept in the EOS (Essence of Software — Daniel Jackson's framework for specifying software concepts as freestanding, composable units) sense. It carries its own state (the hold record set), its own actions (`place`, `release`, `read`), and its own invariants (hold immutability, two-state exclusivity, terminal absorption, concurrent independence, release attribution, store durability). Composing patterns add the purge gate, access control, case management integration, and cross-record batch holds.

## Structure

### Store instance model

The Legal Hold atom operates against a named store instance. A [Store Name] identifies the instance; multiple instances coexist in real systems — one per organization, jurisdiction, or business unit, depending on deployment topology. [Hold Id] values are unique within a store instance; uniqueness across instances is a composing concept. [Record Ref] is an opaque reference scoped to the host system — the same [Record Ref] may be held by multiple simultaneous holds within the same store instance. Calls implicitly target a single routed instance; instance selection is handled at the deployment-routing layer, not defined by this atom.

### Identity model

Each hold has an opaque, immutable, system-generated [Hold Id] — assigned on [Place], never reused, never reassigned within the store instance. It must be a non-empty string sortable in lexicographic byte-order; this property is required for deterministic [Read] ordering. The id is the hold's identity; the record reference, placing actor, reason, and timestamps are properties of the hold, not its identity.

[Record Ref] is an opaque reference to the record being held. Set on [Place], immutable. The atom does not validate that the record exists or is currently retained — [Record Ref] is the caller's responsibility. Two holds over the same record have distinct [Hold Id]s; each is its own audit record with its own lifecycle.

[Placed By] is an opaque reference to the actor placing the hold. Set on [Place], immutable. It is the attribution anchor for the preservation decision; empty or whitespace-only values are rejected at placement.

[Case Ref] is an optional opaque reference to the legal matter, investigation, or audit under which the hold is placed (for example, a case management system identifier or a docket number). Set on [Place], immutable. Its absence is valid — holds may be placed before a formal case is opened, or the case reference system may be external. If supplied, it must contain at least one non-whitespace character.

### Inputs

- [Place] calls from legal counsel, compliance officers, case management integrations, or automated preservation workflows, each carrying a [Record Ref], a placing actor ([Placed By]), a [Reason], an optional [Case Ref], and an optional explicit [Placed At] timestamp.
- [Release] calls documenting that the legal obligation has ended, carrying the [Hold Id], the releasing actor ([Released By]), a required [Reason], and an optional explicit [Released At] timestamp.
- [Read] queries from legal teams, compliance dashboards, audit processes, and litigation support workflows.

### Actions

For optional parameters in both [Place] and [Release], "supplied" means provided as a parseable value of the declared type. Null, missing, and empty (or whitespace-only) values are equivalent to "not supplied," and the action's documented default applies.

- [Place] — (Projected contract: `place(record_ref, placed_by, reason, case_ref?, placed_at?) → hold_id | rejected(invalid-request | storage-failure)`) — place a preservation hold on the named record. Assigns a fresh [Hold Id], records [Record Ref], [Placed By], [Hold Reason], [Case Ref] (if supplied), and [Placed At] (wall clock if not supplied; must not be in the future). The hold enters [Active] state. [Record Ref], [Placed By], and [Reason] must each contain at least one non-whitespace character; [Case Ref], if supplied, must also contain at least one non-whitespace character — any violation is [Invalid Request]. [Storage Failure] if the store write fails after all preconditions pass; no [Hold Id] is issued and no record enters the store.

- [Release] — (Projected contract: `release(hold_id, released_by, reason, released_at?) → released | rejected(invalid-request | not-known | already-released | storage-failure)`) — document the end of the preservation obligation and transition the hold to [Released]. Records [Released By], [Release Reason], and [Released At] (wall clock if not supplied; must not be in the future — releasing a hold in the future is not meaningful); all are immutable after the transition. The [Hold Id] parameter must itself contain at least one non-whitespace character ([Invalid Request]); a null, empty, or whitespace-only [Hold Id] is malformed and rejected before any existence check is performed. [Released By] and [Reason] must each contain at least one non-whitespace character ([Invalid Request]). The resolved [Released At] — whether caller-supplied or wall-clock-defaulted — must be ≥ the hold's [Placed At]; a value less than [Placed At] is [Invalid Request] regardless of how it was derived (this enforces Invariant 6 against clock-skew artifacts as well as caller-supplied backdated values). Releasing a hold on a record does not affect any other hold on the same record. [Storage Failure] leaves the hold in [Active] state; the caller must retry.

- [Read] — (Projected contract: `read(query) → ordered_sequence_of_holds | rejected(invalid-query)`) — return holds matching the [Query], ordered by [Placed At] ascending, then by [Hold Id] ascending in lexicographic byte-order as a stable tiebreaker. Implementations must assign [Hold Id] values in a format where string byte-order sort produces a total order (e.g., ULID — Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier, UUID v7 — version 7 of the Universally Unique Identifier, which is time-ordered, or zero-padded integer string). The supported filter axes are exactly: [Hold Id], [Record Ref], [Placed By], [Case Ref], [State], and time ranges on [Placed At] or [Released At]. Any combination of supported axes is valid. A query supplying only a [Hold Id] returns at most one hold. A well-formed query matching no holds returns an empty sequence, not a rejection. A query with no filters returns every hold in the store. A time range filter on [Released At] returns only holds that carry a [Released At] field — i.e., [Released] holds. [Active] holds carry no [Released At] field and are implicitly excluded from results whenever a [Released At] filter is present, regardless of whether a [State] filter is also supplied. A query `{released_at: {after: X}}` with no state filter returns [Released] holds where `released_at > X`; [Active] holds are not included. A query `{state: Active, released_at: {after: X}}` returns an empty sequence by the same rule. A [Case Ref] filter value matches only holds where [Case Ref] is set and equals the value; holds without [Case Ref] are excluded by any positive [Case Ref] filter (a "find holds that have no [Case Ref]" predicate is not in the spec; if a deployment needs it, the composing layer adds it). The query `{record_ref: X, state: Active}` returns every [Active] hold covering a given record — this is the operational check for whether a record is currently held.

  **Malformed-query rules ([Invalid Query]):** a [Hold Id], [Record Ref], [Placed By], or [Case Ref] filter value that is null, empty, or whitespace-only is [Invalid Query] (the filter axes exist; the values are malformed). A [State] filter value that is not one of {[Active], [Released]} is [Invalid Query]. A time range with end before start is [Invalid Query]. A query carrying an unrecognized filter key — any key outside the supported axes named above — is [Invalid Query]; an unrecognized key is rejected rather than silently ignored, because silent ignore would return a result set inconsistent with the caller's intent.

### Outputs

- For [Place]: a fresh [Hold Id], or a rejection.
- For [Release]: the outcome token `released`, or a rejection.
- For [Read]: a (possibly empty) ordered sequence of holds. Each hold carries its full field set. Fields present on every hold ([Active] or [Released]): [Hold Id], [Record Ref], [Placed By], [Hold Reason], [Placed At], [State]. Optional field set at placement (independent of state): [Case Ref] (present if supplied at [Place], absent otherwise; immutable thereafter). State-specific fields: [Released By], [Release Reason], [Released At] are present on [Released] holds only. A [Released] hold carries all placement fields (including [Case Ref] if it was supplied) and all release fields simultaneously.

### State

Each hold is in exactly one state:

- **[Active]** — the preservation obligation for [Record Ref] is in effect. Any composition wiring this atom to a purge surface must treat an [Active] hold as blocking purge eligibility; the atom records the obligation but does not enforce it internally. The hold carries [Hold Id], [Record Ref], [Placed By], [Hold Reason], [Placed At], and [Case Ref] (if supplied). May only be released (transitioning to [Released]) or read.
- **[Released]** — the preservation obligation has ended. Carries [Released By], [Release Reason], and [Released At] (all immutable from the moment [Release] completes), plus all placement fields. Terminal; no further transitions.

Valid transitions — writes only; every committed transition stamps its timestamp from the receiving node's wall clock:

| action | from | to | guard | stamps | result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Place] | *(no record)* | **[Active]** | [Placed At] (if supplied) not in the future | fresh [Hold Id]; [Record Ref]; [Placed By]; [Hold Reason]; [Case Ref] if supplied; [Placed At] | the new [Hold Id] |
| [Release] | [Active] | **[Released]** | resolved [Released At] not future ∧ ≥ [Placed At] | [Released By]; [Release Reason]; [Released At] | `released` |

No other transitions exist. A hold cannot be re-activated after release; a new preservation obligation requires a new [Place] call producing a new [Hold Id]. [Release] on an already-[Released] hold is rejected [Already Released], writing nothing; concurrent holds on one record are independent (Invariant 4), so releasing one never transitions another.

### Flow

1. **Litigation trigger.** Counsel determines that records relating to Project Alpha are subject to litigation hold. Calls `place(record_ref: "doc-alpha-0012", placed_by: "counsel_morgan", reason: "Litigation hold — Smith v. Acme Corp., SDNY 2026-cv-4421 — all Project Alpha records", case_ref: "matter-2026-smith-acme")` → `hold_id: "hold-001"`. The hold enters [Active].
2. **Second independent hold.** The state AG separately issues a preservation demand covering the same record. Compliance calls `place(record_ref: "doc-alpha-0012", placed_by: "compliance_lee", reason: "NY AG Civil Investigative Demand — Case INV-2026-0089", case_ref: "ag-inv-2026-0089")` → `hold_id: "hold-002"`. Two independent [Active] holds now cover the record.
3. **Internal matter closes.** Smith v. Acme Corp. settles. Counsel calls `release("hold-001", released_by: "counsel_morgan", reason: "Matter settled with prejudice — May 10 2026")` → `released`. Hold-001 is now [Released]. Hold-002 remains [Active]; the record is still held.
4. **AG investigation closes.** AG closes the investigation. `release("hold-002", released_by: "compliance_lee", reason: "NY AG CID withdrawn — May 28 2026")` → `released`. No [Active] holds remain on the record; the composing layer resumes normal retention governance.
5. **Audit query.** A later audit queries `read({record_ref: "doc-alpha-0012"})` and sees both holds with full placement and release attribution. The record's complete legal hold history is recoverable without recourse to external systems.

### Decision points

- **At [Place]** — [Record Ref], [Placed By], and [Reason] must each contain at least one non-whitespace character; [Case Ref], if supplied, must also contain at least one non-whitespace character; [Placed At], if supplied, must not be in the future (checked against the receiving node's wall clock). Any violation is [Invalid Request]. [Storage Failure] if the store write fails; no [Hold Id] is issued, no record enters the store.

- **At [Release]** — the [Hold Id] parameter is checked first: if null, empty, or whitespace-only, the call is [Invalid Request] (the caller passed garbage, not a reference to a missing hold). If [Hold Id] is well-formed, the store is consulted: [Not Known] if no hold with this id exists; [Already Released] if the hold is in [Released] state. If neither, attribution and temporal checks apply: [Released By] and [Reason] must each contain at least one non-whitespace character ([Invalid Request]); the resolved [Released At] — caller-supplied or wall-clock-defaulted — must not be in the future (the future-bound applies only when caller-supplied, because a wall-clock default is "now" by construction) and must be ≥ the hold's [Placed At]. The ≥ [Placed At] bound applies to the resolved [Released At] regardless of how it was derived; this enforces Invariant 6 against clock-skew artifacts as well as caller-supplied backdated values. A violation is [Invalid Request]. [Storage Failure] leaves the hold in [Active]; the caller must retry. Rejection priority: malformed [Hold Id] ([Invalid Request]) → [Not Known] → [Already Released] → attribution/temporal ([Invalid Request]) → [Storage Failure].

- **At [Read]** — every supplied filter value must be well-formed for its axis. A [Hold Id], [Record Ref], [Placed By], or [Case Ref] filter value that is null, empty, or whitespace-only is [Invalid Query]. A [State] filter value not in {[Active], [Released]} is [Invalid Query]. A time range with end before start is [Invalid Query]. An unrecognized filter key — any key outside the supported axes — is [Invalid Query]; the spec rejects rather than ignores unknown keys. A [Released At] filter implicitly excludes [Active] holds, which carry no [Released At] field, regardless of whether a [State] filter is also present. A [Case Ref] filter excludes holds without [Case Ref]. A well-formed query matching no holds returns an empty sequence.

### Behavior

- **Holds are durable on success.** Once [Place] returns a [Hold Id], the hold is in the store and will appear in subsequent reads.
- **Hold placement is not idempotent.** Two [Place] calls for the same [Record Ref], [Placed By], and [Reason] create two independent holds with distinct [Hold Id]s.
- **Concurrent holds are independent.** Multiple [Active] holds on the same [Record Ref] do not interact. Releasing hold A leaves hold B unaffected. The aggregate "is this record held?" question is answered by querying `{record_ref: X, state: Active}` and checking whether the result is non-empty; the atom does not maintain a separate aggregate state.
- **[Released] state is terminal and auditable.** A [Released] hold carries the full placement and release record. It is the audit evidence of the complete preservation arc — when the hold was placed, by whom, why, and when it was lifted. Releasing a hold does not remove its record from the store.
- **The atom does not enforce the purge gate.** Whether a held record is actually prevented from being purged is enforced at the composing layer (Retention Window + Legal Hold composition). The atom records that a preservation obligation exists; the composition enforces it at the purge surface.
- **Reads are repeatable; the hold store is monotonic.** The hold store only grows — [Place] adds records, [Release] transitions them. An unfiltered read at `t2 > t1` returns every hold visible at `t1` plus any added in between. State-filtered reads are not monotonic: a hold visible under `state: Active` at `t1` may appear under `state: Released` at `t2` if released in between.

### Feedback

- After [Place] — a new [Active] hold record exists; [Hold Id], [Record Ref], [Placed By], [Hold Reason], [Placed At], and [Case Ref] (if supplied) are set and immutable.
- After [Release] — the hold is now [Released]; [Released By], [Release Reason], and [Released At] are set and immutable. All placement fields are unchanged.

Each rejected action produces an observable refusal naming the failed precondition.

### Invariants

- **Invariant 1 — Hold immutability.** After a successful [Place], the fields [Hold Id], [Record Ref], [Placed By], [Hold Reason], [Placed At], and [Case Ref] never change, regardless of any subsequent action.

- **Invariant 2 — Membership exclusivity.** Every hold known to the store is in exactly one of {[Active], [Released]} at all times.

- **Invariant 3 — Terminal absorption.** Once a hold transitions to [Released], no action transitions it further. The atom has no re-activate surface; a new preservation need requires a new [Place].

- **Invariant 4 — Concurrent holds are independent.** Releasing hold H on record R does not change the state of any other hold H′ on the same record R. The [Active]/[Released] state of each hold is determined solely by whether [Release] has been called on that specific [Hold Id].

- **Invariant 5 — Release attribution is complete.** Every [Released] hold carries [Released By] and [Release Reason] each containing at least one non-whitespace character, and a [Released At] timestamp that is set. An anonymous release, an unexplained release, a whitespace-only attribution string, or a release with no timestamp is a conformance failure — each defeats the audit trail that legal proceedings depend on.

- **Invariant 6 — Temporal ordering.** For every [Released] hold, [Released At] ≥ [Placed At]. A hold cannot be documented as released before it was placed. The constraint applies to the value persisted in the record, regardless of whether [Released At] was caller-supplied or wall-clock-defaulted; the [Release] Decision point enforces this against the resolved value before the transition is committed.

- **Invariant 7 — Placement attribution is complete.** Every hold, [Active] or [Released], carries [Hold Id], [Record Ref], [Placed By], and [Hold Reason] each containing at least one non-whitespace character, and a [Placed At] timestamp that is set. Invariant 1 guarantees these fields are immutable; this invariant guarantees they are never blank or unset. An anonymous placement, a whitespace-only reason, or a missing timestamp is a conformance failure — it defeats the chain of custody a court requires to establish when and why the preservation obligation was recognized.

- **Invariant 8 — Hold store durability.** No hold record is removed from the store. The total hold count is monotonically non-decreasing. A [Hold Id] returned by a successful [Place] is durably persisted; a [Storage Failure] rejection guarantees no partial record was written. [Released] holds are retained as audit evidence; deleting a [Released] hold would destroy the proof that the preservation obligation was honored and lawfully lifted.

## Examples

### Happy path — litigation hold through release

See Flow section. A complete hold arc is walked there: placement by counsel, second independent hold by compliance, release of the first, continued preservation under the second, eventual release of the second, and a later audit query recovering the full history.

### Rejection path — release attempted twice

After hold-001 is [Released], counsel's paralegal system retries: `release("hold-001", released_by: "system_retry", reason: "automated retry")` → `rejected(already-released)`. The hold record is unchanged. The paralegal system detects the rejection and suppresses the retry.

### Rejection path — place with empty reason

`place(record_ref: "doc-0099", placed_by: "compliance_chen", reason: "   ")` → `rejected(invalid-request)`. Whitespace-only reason is treated as empty. No hold is created.

### Rejection path — release with future timestamp

`release("hold-007", released_by: "counsel_kim", reason: "case closed", released_at: "2027-01-01T00:00:00Z")` → `rejected(invalid-request)`. A release documented as occurring in the future is not operationally meaningful; the atom records the present obligation, not a future intent.

### Regulated adversarial scenarios

#### Regulator audit — HHS OCR HIPAA investigation

HHS (US Department of Health and Human Services — the federal agency that enforces HIPAA) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) opens an investigation into a reported breach of PHI (Protected Health Information — individually identifiable health data covered by HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the US federal law governing healthcare data privacy). It issues a preservation demand to the covered entity for all records relating to the incident. The compliance team calls [Place] for each record in scope; each placement carries `case_ref: "ocr-hipaa-inv-2026-0334"`. Two months later, OCR requests the preservation record: query `read({case_ref: "ocr-hipaa-inv-2026-0334", state: Active})` returns every [Active] hold placed under this investigation. Every hold carries [Placed By] and [Hold Reason] strings each with at least one non-whitespace character, and a [Placed At] timestamp that is set — immutable by Invariants 1 and 7. OCR confirms that preservation was initiated and that each hold is still [Active]. The covered entity has a documentable, auditable preservation response; no recourse to developer testimony is needed.

#### Spoliation challenge — federal litigation

Opposing counsel in federal litigation argues that the defendant destroyed documents after the duty to preserve was triggered under FRCP (Federal Rules of Civil Procedure — the rules governing civil lawsuits in US federal courts) Rule 37(e). Defendant's counsel queries `read({record_ref: "doc-contract-077"})` for all holds ever placed on the disputed document. The query returns the hold placed on the record, with `placed_at: 2026-02-14` — the date the preservation obligation was recognized. The opposing party claims the document was destroyed on `2026-02-10`. The hold record shows [Placed At] postdating the destruction. If a corresponding purge record from Retention Window shows `purged_at: 2026-02-10` and no [Active] hold existed at that time, the records faithfully document the chronology — the hold was placed after the purge. If the document was never purged and remains in the store, the hold records confirm ongoing preservation. Either way, the court has the complete record; the atom does not manufacture a defense but it does not hide the facts either.

#### Concurrent hold integrity — dual regulatory investigation

A financial institution is simultaneously under a DOJ (US Department of Justice) criminal investigation and an SEC (US Securities and Exchange Commission — the federal regulator of securities markets) civil enforcement action. Both issue preservation demands covering the same set of trading records. The compliance team places holds under both matters:

- `hold-doj-001` through `hold-doj-240`: `case_ref: "doj-crim-2026-0011"`
- `hold-sec-001` through `hold-sec-240`: `case_ref: "sec-enf-2026-0087"`

The DOJ investigation closes first. The compliance team releases all `hold-doj-*` holds. Query `read({record_ref: "trade-record-0042", state: Active})` returns `hold-sec-042` — the SEC hold remains [Active]. Invariant 4 guarantees that releasing the DOJ holds had no effect on the SEC holds. The institution correctly continues to preserve the records under SEC obligation. An auditor reviewing the hold records sees the full picture: two independent regulatory demands, one resolved, one active, no record destroyed while any [Active] hold covered it.

---

## Generation acceptance

Any implementation derived from this atom must produce records and a runtime surface that pass the following checks from the records alone, without recourse to source code, runbooks, or developer narration:

1. **Hold completeness check.** For a set of [Hold Id]s known to have been issued, confirm that `read({hold_id: X})` returns each of them across all states. No issued [Hold Id] may be absent from the store.

2. **Placement attribution check — both states.** For every hold in the store, in any state: confirm [Placed By], [Hold Reason], [Record Ref], and [Hold Id] each contain at least one non-whitespace character, and confirm [Placed At] is set (present, not null). This applies equally to [Active] and [Released] holds — Invariant 7 covers both. A hold in either state with a blank attribution string or a missing [Placed At] is a conformance failure under Invariant 7.

3. **Release attribution check.** For every [Released] hold: confirm [Released By] and [Release Reason] each contain at least one non-whitespace character, confirm [Released At] is set, and confirm [Released At] ≥ [Placed At] (Invariant 6). A [Released] hold with a blank attribution string, a missing [Released At], or an inverted temporal ordering is a conformance failure under Invariants 5 and 6.

4. **Hold independence check.** Place two holds on the same [Record Ref]. Release the first. Confirm that `read({hold_id: second_hold_id})` returns a hold still in [Active] state. Confirm that `read({record_ref: X, state: Active})` returns the second hold only. Invariant 4 guarantees independence; this check verifies it.

5. **Terminal absorption check.** Attempt [Release] against a known [Released] hold. The call must return `rejected(already-released)`. Confirm the hold's fields are unchanged after the attempted release.

6. **Store monotonicity check.** At time `t1`, issue `read({})` (unfiltered) and record the result set S1. Place one new hold and confirm the [Place] call returned a [Hold Id]. At time `t2 > t1`, issue `read({})` again and record result set S2. Confirm every hold in S1 appears in S2 by [Hold Id] (no hold is removed). For each hold present in both S1 and S2, confirm the placement fields ([Hold Id], [Record Ref], [Placed By], [Hold Reason], [Placed At], and [Case Ref] if it was set in S1) are unchanged in S2 — placement fields are immutable per Invariant 1. Release fields ([Released By], [Release Reason], [Released At]) may newly appear on holds released between t1 and t2; their appearance is conformant with the state machine and is **not** a monotonicity violation. The state of any hold present in both sets may legitimately have transitioned from [Active] to [Released]; the reverse transition is a conformance failure. The total hold count in S2 is ≥ the count in S1. Confirms the behavioral guarantee that the hold store is monotonically non-decreasing and that placement fields are immutable, while distinguishing the legitimate [Active]→[Released] transition from a violation.

## Non-goals and edge cases

- **Hold placed after record is purged.** The atom does not prevent placing a hold on a [Record Ref] for which the underlying record has already been destroyed. The hold is created successfully; the [Record Ref] is an opaque value the atom does not validate against the storage layer. The hold record faithfully documents that a preservation obligation was recognized after the fact. Legal counsel and the court assess the spoliative implications — the atom records the truth, it does not adjudicate it. Whether post-purge hold placement triggers any remediation belongs to the composing layer and to legal counsel.

- **Multiple concurrent holds and aggregate held status.** A record with N [Active] holds requires N [Release] calls to fully lift all holds. The atom has no `release_all` action — bulk release of all holds covering a record is a composing-layer operation that calls [Place] and [Release] appropriately. The aggregate "is this record currently held?" question is answered by `read({record_ref: X, state: Active})` returning a non-empty sequence; if the sequence is empty, no [Active] holds cover the record.

- **[Place] is not idempotent.** A prescriber system that retries after a network timeout creates a duplicate hold if the first call succeeded. For at-most-once semantics on hold placement, compose with [Duplicate Prevention](./duplicate-prevention.md).

- **Hold on a record that does not exist in the retention system.** [Record Ref] is opaque; the atom does not validate it against a retention store, a document management system, or any other external system. Placing a hold on a non-existent or misspelled [Record Ref] creates a hold record. The hold is real from this atom's perspective; the record it names may not be. The composing system is responsible for ensuring [Record Ref] values are valid. For high-stakes litigation holds, a validation step against the retention store belongs in the composing workflow.

- **Case reference without a formal case.** [Case Ref] is optional precisely because preservation obligations arise before formal litigation is filed — when litigation is "reasonably anticipated" under FRCP, when a regulatory inquiry is received informally, or when an internal investigation is underway without a docket number. Holds without [Case Ref] are valid; [Hold Reason] carries the narrative explanation. No amendment mechanism exists; the immutability of [Case Ref] after placement is load-bearing for legal proceedings. When a formal case reference later attaches to a hold that was placed without one, the correct workflow is to **place a new, independent hold** carrying the [Case Ref], leaving the original hold [Active] for as long as its underlying preservation obligation persists. The original is **not** released merely to re-catalog under a case reference — releasing it would write [Released At], [Released By], and [Release Reason] for an obligation that has not actually ended, poisoning the audit trail with a release event that an external evaluator could reasonably read as suspicious record manipulation. Invariant 4 (concurrent holds are independent) makes both holds preserve the record in parallel; the new hold's [Hold Reason] can narrate the relationship to the original. The original is released only when its preservation obligation genuinely ends.

- **Purge gate enforcement.** Whether a record covered by an [Active] hold is actually prevented from being purged is not enforced by this atom. This is deliberately outside scope: enforcement requires the purge surface to check for [Active] holds, which requires integrating Legal Hold with the storage or retention layer. That integration is the [Regulated Record Retention & Defensible Deletion](../roadmap.md) composition (Legal Hold + Retention Window + Audit Trail). Deployments that query hold records as an advisory check without wiring the gate are non-conforming to the composition's invariants but conforming to this atom's invariants.

- **Access control.** Who may [Place] holds, who may [Release] them, and who may [Read] them is not defined by this atom. That is the obligation of a composing [Permissions](./permissions.md) pattern. In many deployments, hold placement is restricted to legal counsel or designated compliance officers; unauthorized placement or release of holds is a serious process failure that Permissions governs.

- **Case management and legal matter lifecycle.** Tracking the legal matter itself — parties, counsel, status, court, settlement terms, matter type — is out of scope. [Case Ref] is an opaque pointer into an external case management system. This atom makes no claims about what that system contains.

- **Batch holds across multiple records.** One [Place] call creates one hold on one [Record Ref]. Bulk holds (all records matching a query, all records in a folder, all records within a date range) are a composing-layer operation. The composing layer iterates the matching records and calls [Place] for each; the resulting holds are individually releasable. Atomic batch placement — where all records in a batch are held or none are — requires a transaction wrapper in the composing layer.

- **Retention Window interaction.** Legal Hold and Retention Window are composing peers. This atom does not import Retention Window semantics; it records preservation obligations. The composition that enforces the purge gate must check both: no purge before `retention_until`, and no purge while any [Active] hold covers the record.

- **Tamper-evidence.** The atom guarantees immutability by specification; it does not cryptographically prevent a store administrator from altering hold records. For court-admissible evidence of record preservation, compose with [Tamper Evidence](./tamper-evidence.md), which provides cryptographic sealing of the hold records. Tamper-evident hold records are required under several regulatory regimes (SEC Rule 17a-4, 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Part 11 in regulated clinical contexts).

- **Clock semantics.** [Placed At] and [Released At] default to the receiving node's wall clock when not supplied. [Placed At] must not be in the future — a hold cannot logically be placed in the future. Back-dated [Placed At] values are accepted; documenting a preservation obligation recognized late is valid and often necessary. Courts scrutinize backdated hold timestamps in spoliation disputes, but the atom records what the caller supplies without interpretation; legal counsel owns the evidentiary consequences. [Released At] must not be in the future and must be ≥ [Placed At] (enforced at the [Release] Decision point). Back-dated [Released At] values are accepted — documenting a release that was communicated or recognized at an earlier time is valid. Clock skew, timezone normalization, and monotonicity are handled at the deployment layer.

- **Concurrency.** Two systems concurrently calling [Release] on the same [Hold Id] must be serialized. The first succeeds; the second receives [Already Released]. Implementations must serialize state transitions on a given [Hold Id].

## Terms

The canonical concepts this spec refers to. Each `[Term]` marker in the prose above links to its card here. A card states what the concept *is*, in plain English, plus its **Kind** — one of four: **Type** (a thing or category), **Operation** (a behavior), **Member** (a value of an enumerated Type), or, for a named datum, **Field** (a datum a Type carries — *what does it carry?*) or **Parameter** (a value an Operation needs — *what does it need?*). A card also names the Type it is a **Member of** / **Field of**, the Operation it is a **Parameter of**, and its **Role** where the domain assigns one. A card carries one **Projects** line — the concept's single canonical lowering token, the one place the concrete name stays visible on the page — for every Field, Parameter, and pinned/wire Member. Everything else about casing (each target's snake / camel / pascal / const / wire form) is **derived** from that one token by [`tools/harness/term-adapter.mjs`](../tools/harness/term-adapter.mjs), never hand-written. *(annotation.md Terms registry; representational only — it changes no guarantee, invariant, or behavior of the atom above.)*

#### Place

The behavior that records a new preservation hold against a record. It assigns a fresh [Hold Id], stamps [Placed At], records [Record Ref], [Placed By], [Hold Reason], and [Case Ref] (if supplied), and returns the [Hold Id] (or a rejection). The hold enters [Active].

Kind: Operation

#### Release

The behavior that documents the end of a preservation obligation, transitioning an [Active] hold to [Released] and recording [Released By], [Release Reason], and [Released At]. A [Released] hold cannot be released again ([Already Released]); releasing one hold never affects another on the same record (Invariant 4).

Kind: Operation

#### Read

The read-only behavior that returns the holds matching a [Query], ordered by [Placed At] ascending then [Hold Id] ascending. It changes nothing. Filters by [Hold Id], [Record Ref], [Placed By], [Case Ref], [State], or time range are combinable; the query `{record_ref: X, state: Active}` is the operational "is this record held?" check.

Kind: Operation

#### Hold Id

The opaque, immutable, system-generated identity of a hold, assigned on [Place], never reused or reassigned within the store instance. A non-empty string sortable in lexicographic byte-order — required for deterministic [Read] ordering. The record, actor, reason, and timestamps are properties of the hold, not its identity.

Kind:     Field
Field of: the hold record
Projects: hold_id

#### Record Ref

The opaque reference to the record being held. Set on [Place], immutable, never validated against any storage layer. Multiple holds may name the same [Record Ref]; each is an independent hold.

Kind:     Field
Field of: the hold record
Projects: record_ref

#### Placed By

The opaque reference to the actor placing the hold — the attribution anchor for the preservation decision. Set on [Place], immutable; empty or whitespace-only is rejected (Invariant 7).

Kind:     Field
Field of: the hold record
Projects: placed_by

#### Hold Reason

The required, non-empty narrative for the hold — written from the [Reason] parameter at [Place]. Set on [Place], immutable (Invariants 1 and 7). Carries the proportionality/scope explanation a court expects.

Kind:     Field
Field of: the hold record
Projects: hold_reason

#### Placed At

The timestamp the hold was placed — supplied or defaulted to the receiving node's wall clock; must not be future. Set on [Place], immutable. The lower bound for [Released At] (Invariant 6) and the ordering key for [Read].

Kind:     Field
Field of: the hold record
Projects: placed_at

#### Case Ref

The optional opaque reference to the legal matter, investigation, or audit. Set on [Place] if supplied (then immutable); its absence is valid. A positive [Case Ref] filter excludes holds without one.

Kind:     Field
Field of: the hold record
Projects: case_ref

#### State

The hold's lifecycle state — [Active] or [Released]. Set to [Active] on [Place]; transitions once to [Released] via [Release]. Every hold is in exactly one state (Invariant 2).

Kind:     Field
Field of: the hold record
Projects: state

#### Released By

The opaque reference to the actor releasing the hold. Set at [Release], immutable; present on [Released] holds only. Non-null required (Invariant 5).

Kind:     Field
Field of: the hold record
Projects: released_by

#### Release Reason

The required, non-empty reason for the release — written from the [Reason] parameter at [Release]. Set at [Release], immutable; present on [Released] holds only (Invariant 5).

Kind:     Field
Field of: the hold record
Projects: release_reason

#### Released At

The timestamp the hold was released — supplied or defaulted to wall clock; must not be future and must be ≥ [Placed At] (Invariant 6). Set at [Release], immutable; present on [Released] holds only.

Kind:     Field
Field of: the hold record
Projects: released_at

#### Store Name

The identifier of the store instance a hold belongs to. Multiple instances coexist; [Hold Id]s are unique within an instance, while [Record Ref] is host-scoped. No action accepts it as a parameter — instance selection is handled at the deployment-routing layer.

Kind:     Field
Field of: the store instance
Projects: store_name

#### Reason

The required, non-empty reason string [Place] and [Release] consume — written into [Hold Reason] or [Release Reason] respectively. Not stored under this name; an empty or whitespace-only value is rejected [Invalid Request].

Kind:         Parameter
Parameter of: Place
Projects:     reason

#### Query

The selection [Read] consumes — a filter over [Hold Id], [Record Ref], [Placed By], [Case Ref], [State], and/or a time range on [Placed At] or [Released At]. Supplied per call, not stored; a malformed one is rejected [Invalid Query].

Kind:         Parameter
Parameter of: Read
Projects:     query

#### Active

The non-terminal state of a hold whose preservation obligation is in effect. A composition wiring this atom to a purge surface treats an [Active] hold as blocking purge. May be released or read.

Kind:      Member
Member of: the hold state
Role:      Outcome

#### Released

The terminal state of a hold whose preservation obligation has ended. Carries [Released By], [Release Reason], and [Released At]; retained as audit evidence, no further transition (Invariant 3).

Kind:      Member
Member of: the hold state
Role:      Outcome

#### Invalid Request

The refusal [Place] or [Release] returns when request fields fail — an empty/whitespace [Record Ref], [Placed By], [Reason], [Case Ref], [Released By], or [Hold Id]; a future [Placed At]; or a [Released At] that is future or before [Placed At].

Kind:      Member
Member of: the action rejection
Role:      Outcome
Projects:  invalid-request

#### Not Known

The refusal [Release] returns when the named [Hold Id] references no hold in this store instance — a lookup miss (a common cause is cross-instance referencing).

Kind:      Member
Member of: the Release rejection
Role:      Outcome
Projects:  not-known

#### Already Released

The refusal [Release] returns when the target is already [Released] — terminal absorption (Invariant 3); a pure guard that writes nothing.

Kind:      Member
Member of: the Release rejection
Role:      Outcome
Projects:  already-released

#### Storage Failure

The refusal any writing action returns when a durable write fails after preconditions pass. All-or-none: no partial record is observable, and the prior state is unchanged (Invariant 8).

Kind:      Member
Member of: the action rejection
Role:      Outcome
Projects:  storage-failure

#### Invalid Query

The refusal [Read] returns when query parameters are malformed — a null/empty/whitespace filter value, a [State] value outside {[Active], [Released]}, a time range with end before start, or an unrecognized filter key.

Kind:      Member
Member of: the Read rejection
Role:      Outcome
Projects:  invalid-query

## Composition notes

Legal Hold is the preservation primitive the library has held open since Retention Window was grounded. Every atom in `compliance` and every atom in `healthcare` ultimately composes with it when records must be preserved against destruction:

- **[Retention Window](./retention-window.md)** — the primary composing peer. Legal Hold overrides Retention Window's purge eligibility: while any [Active] hold covers a record, `purge` must be rejected regardless of whether `retention_until` has elapsed. Neither atom enforces the other's constraint; the gate belongs to the **[Defensible Retention](../compositions/defensible-retention.md)** composition.
- **[Audit Trail](../compositions/audit-trail.md)** — every [Place] and [Release] event is an auditable action; Audit Trail provides the tamper-evident, attributed, retention-governed record of every hold lifecycle event.
- **[Tamper Evidence](./tamper-evidence.md)** — seals hold records against post-hoc modification. Court-admissible hold records require cryptographic integrity guarantees beyond this atom's spec-level immutability.
- **[Actor Identity](./actor-identity.md)** — [Placed By] and [Released By] are opaque references; Actor Identity provides cryptographic attestation that those references are real, credentialed actors who authorized their respective actions. In regulated contexts (SOX — the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, US law on corporate financial reporting and records integrity; 21 CFR Part 11), hold placement is an electronic record requiring verifiable authorship.
- **[Permissions](./permissions.md)** — governs who may [Place], [Release], or [Read] holds. Legal hold placement is a privileged action in every regulated deployment.
- **[Duplicate Prevention](./duplicate-prevention.md)** — for at-most-once semantics on hold placement under retry conditions.
- **[Medication Order](./medication-order.md)** — in healthcare, an active investigation or litigation hold may cover medication order records and their associated clinical observations. Legal Hold composes directly with any record-producing atom when that record's destruction must be suspended.
- **[Clinical Observation](./clinical-observation.md)** — same as Medication Order; clinical observations under malpractice litigation or HHS investigation are subject to legal hold.
- **[Defensible Retention](../compositions/defensible-retention.md)** — Legal Hold + Retention Window + Audit Trail, wired to enforce the purge gate. **[Resolve a Person's Data Rights](../compositions/resolve-a-persons-data-rights.md)** — reaches Legal Hold *transitively* through Defensible Retention: an [Active] hold is what maps a Defensible Retention `purge_record` block to the `retained(legal-hold)` erasure disposition (GDPR Article 17(3)(e)), the operational form of "an erasure request may be declined because a hold preserves the record."

## Standards references

- **Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 37(e)** — the primary U.S. federal standard for electronic discovery preservation. A party must take reasonable steps to preserve ESI (Electronically Stored Information — digital records subject to legal discovery) once litigation is reasonably anticipated; failure to preserve when an [Active] hold should have been in place exposes the party to sanctions including adverse inference instructions. The [Placed At] timestamp and [Hold Reason] field are the record of when and why the preservation obligation was recognized.
- **Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 26(b)** — proportionality doctrine for discovery preservation; not all records must be held, only those reasonably expected to be relevant. [Hold Reason] and [Case Ref] are the scoping fields that document proportionality.
- **Sedona Conference Principles (3rd ed.)** — the leading authoritative guidance on electronic discovery preservation obligations. Principle 5: a party is not required to preserve every document; preservation must be proportionate. Principle 6: a party should consider adoption of a litigation hold policy. The [Hold Reason] field is the policy documentation surface.
- **SOX §802 (18 U.S.C. §1519)** — criminal obstruction-of-justice provision for destruction of documents subject to federal investigation or proceedings. An [Active] Legal Hold covering the relevant records is the structural defense against §802 exposure.
- **SEC Rule 17a-4(f)** — requires broker-dealers to preserve records in non-rewriteable, non-erasable format, accessible to regulators on demand. Legal Hold composes with Tamper Evidence to meet this standard; the hold record itself is a regulated record under 17a-4.
- **HIPAA §164.530(j)** — documentation retention requirements; HHS investigations trigger preservation obligations over the PHI and administrative records involved. Legal Hold is the preservation mechanism.
- **HIPAA Breach Notification Rule (45 CFR §164.400–414)** — breach investigations generate preservation obligations over the records relating to the incident. [Case Ref] references the OCR investigation case identifier.
- **GDPR (EU General Data Protection Regulation — the European Union's data-privacy law) Article 17(3)(e)** — erasure right (right to be forgotten) does not apply when processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims. An [Active] Legal Hold is the operational record that establishes the legal-claim exception to erasure. See [Resolve a Person's Data Rights](../compositions/resolve-a-persons-data-rights.md), whose `retained(legal-hold)` disposition is the records-alone form of this exception.
- **21 CFR Part 11** — electronic records and signatures in FDA-regulated contexts. Preservation holds on regulated records (clinical trial data, manufacturing batch records) must be attributable and non-alterable. Composes with Actor Identity and Tamper Evidence.
- **E-SIGN Act (Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act) / UETA (Uniform Electronic Transactions Act)** — electronic hold records carry the same legal force as paper hold notices where these acts apply.
- **ISO 15489-1 (Records management)** — the International Organization for Standardization's standard for records-management practice; hold is the operational mechanism for Section 9.7 (suspension of disposition). The two-state ([Active]/[Released]) model maps directly to ISO 15489's hold lifecycle.
