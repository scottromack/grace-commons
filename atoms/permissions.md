## Summary

Permissions answers one question: "is this actor allowed to do this thing right now?" It works through grants — explicit records that tie a subject (the actor wanting access) to an action scope (the set of operations the grant covers). A grant stays in force until it is revoked, and revocation is immediate and permanent. Checking permission is a pure read-only lookup. If any active grant matches the subject and scope being asked about, the answer is "permitted"; otherwise it is "denied." There is no implicit access — no grant means no permission, always. The whole decision rests on stored records, so any auditor can re-run the same check and get the same answer. That is exactly what regulated access control needs: issue a grant when access is authorized, revoke it when it ends, check on every attempt, and the records show who could do what, from when to when. The pattern deliberately leaves out roles, attribute-based policies, scope hierarchies, delegation, and time-limited grants. Each is a separate pattern built on top of this minimal grant store.

---

## Intent

Every system that distinguishes actors must eventually answer the question *"is this actor allowed to do this thing?"* The answer must be derivable from stored records alone — not from the memory of whoever configured the system, not from the code that enforces it. The authorization surface needs to be auditable, revocable, and verifiable in the same adversarial contexts that any other regulated record must survive.

The pattern addresses the *can* question that Actor Identity cannot answer. Actor Identity records *who authorized an action after the fact*; Permissions determines *whether an action is allowed before it occurs*. Both are required in a complete authorization story; neither substitutes for the other.

A grant is the atom's unit of authorization: a binding of a subject to an [Action Scope] that remains [Active] until revoked. Evaluation is grant-lookup: if any [Active] grant exists for the queried (subject, scope) pair, the answer is [Permitted]; otherwise [Denied]. No [Active] grant, no permission — there is no implicit permission and no notion of a default-allow posture within this atom.

This is a freestanding (can be specified without naming any other pattern) atom in the EOS (Essence of Software — Daniel Jackson's framework for specifying software concepts as freestanding, composable units) sense. It has its own state (the grant set), its own actions ([Grant], [Revoke], [Check]), and its own operational principles (grants are immutable once recorded; revocation (the explicit removal of a previously granted permission) is terminal; evaluation is a read-only query over the [Active] grant set). It does not implement role management, attribute-based policy evaluation, delegation, inheritance, hierarchical scope matching, or time-bounded grants. Each is a separate composable pattern; see Composition notes.

## Structure

### Identity model

Every grant known to the system has a **[Grant Id]** — an opaque, immutable identifier host-allocated at the I/O seam (injected into the transition, not generated inside it) on [Grant]. The id is the grant's identity; the [Subject Ref] and [Action Scope] are immutable *properties* of the grant, not its identity.

Two grants with the same subject and scope have different ids. This matters: a subject may hold multiple independent grants covering the same scope — issued at different times, by different grantors, under different policies. Revocation of one grant does not affect others. The evaluation query is satisfied by *any* [Active] grant matching the (subject, scope) pair; the id is the handle for revocation.

Ids are not reused after a grant is revoked.

The opaque-id model is the same discipline used across the library: identifying grants by ([Subject Ref], [Action Scope]) would collapse independent grants into a single record, making selective revocation impossible and making the audit trail — which grant authorized which access, issued when — unreadable. Opaque ids preserve the one-grant-one-id discipline that makes per-grant revocation and per-grant audit tractable.

### Inputs

- A [Subject Ref] identifying *who* holds the grant. Opaque — the actor registry is a separate concept.
- An [Action Scope] identifying *what* the grant covers. Opaque — the composing system defines scope semantics and how to express scope membership. This atom does exact matching on the scope value; scope hierarchy, wildcard expansion, and overlap resolution belong to composing patterns.
- Actions:
  - [Grant] — record a new grant binding a [Subject Ref] to an [Action Scope]. (Projected contract: `grant(subject_ref, action_scope) → grant_id | rejected(invalid-request | storage-failure)`.)
  - [Revoke] — withdraw a recorded grant, by id. (Projected contract: `revoke(grant_id) → ok | rejected(not-known | not-active | storage-failure)`.)
  - [Check] — evaluate whether a (subject, scope) pair holds an [Active] grant. (Projected contract: `permitted(subject_ref, action_scope) → permitted | denied`.)
- A clock providing wall-time timestamps and an id source for [Grant Id] allocation, both injected at the atom's single I/O seam. Per the Logic Confinement Principle (see [`execution-contract.md`](../execution-contract.md)), the host reads the clock and allocates the [Grant Id] at the seam before the transition runs; the pure transition receives [Now] and [Grant Id] as inputs and reads no clock and mints no id internally. Neither is supplied by the business caller — which keeps the transition deterministic.

**String input policy (applies to every string input).** Values are byte-exact — no trimming, Unicode normalization, or case folding before storage or comparison. A whitespace-only string counts as empty and is rejected wherever non-empty is required. The deployment sets a maximum length per string input; an over-length value is rejected by [Grant] and treated as non-matching by [Check]. [Check] applies the same byte-exact equality it uses for matching.

### Outputs

- The current set of grants ([Active] and [Revoked]).
- For each grant: [Grant Id], [Subject Ref], [Action Scope], [Granted At], [Status], and [Revoked At] (if revoked).
- [Grant] returns the new [Grant Id] on success, or a rejection naming the failed precondition.
- [Revoke] returns `ok` on success, or a rejection naming the failed precondition.
- [Check] returns [Permitted] or [Denied]. It does not reject — both outcomes are first-class results.

### State

A grant occupies one of two named states:

- **[Active]** — the grant is in force; it contributes to [Check] evaluations.
- **[Revoked]** — the grant has been withdrawn; it no longer contributes to [Check] evaluations. Revocation is terminal.

Each grant carries:

- **[Grant Id]** — opaque, immutable, host-allocated at the I/O seam (injected into the transition, not generated inside it). Set on [Grant]. Never changes.
- **[Subject Ref]** — opaque reference to the subject holding the grant. Set on [Grant]. Never changes.
- **[Action Scope]** — opaque reference to the scope of the grant. Set on [Grant]. Never changes.
- **[Granted At]** — wall-time when the grant was recorded. Set on [Grant]. Never changes.
- **[Status]** — [Active] or [Revoked]. Set to [Active] on [Grant]; transitions to [Revoked] on [Revoke].
- **[Revoked At]** — wall-time when the grant was revoked. Absent while [Active]; set on [Revoke]. Never changes after set.

Transitions — [Grant] and [Revoke] are the two writing transitions; [Check] is a read-only query, listed for contrast (it changes nothing). Each writing transition stamps its timestamp from the injected [Now], and no transition reads the clock internally:

| action | from | to | guard | stamps | result | rejections |
|--------|------|----|-------|--------|--------|-----------|
| [Grant] | *(no record)* | **[Active]** | — | fresh [Grant Id]; [Subject Ref]; [Action Scope]; [Granted At] = [Now] | the new [Grant Id] | [Invalid Request]; [Storage Failure] |
| [Revoke] | [Active] | **[Revoked]** | grant is in [Active] | [Revoked At] = [Now] | `ok` | [Not Known]; [Not Active]; [Storage Failure] |
| [Check] *(read-only — not a transition)* | [Active] | *[Active]* (unchanged) | — | **nothing written** | [Permitted] / [Denied] | — |

Four semantics the cells cannot hold:

- *[Check] is a read-only, first-class-outcome query — never a rejection.* It writes nothing and changes no record. It returns [Permitted] if any [Active] grant exists where `grant.subject_ref = subject_ref` and `grant.action_scope = action_scope`, otherwise [Denied]. Both outcomes are first-class results, not rejections; [Check] has no rejection path. A [Permitted] result with an empty active-grant set is structurally impossible — no matching [Active] grant means [Denied], always.
- *The [Revoke] store-write failure is security-critical and must never be read as confirmed revocation.* If the state transition ([Active] → [Revoked]) computes successfully but the store write then fails, the atom returns [Storage Failure] and the grant remains [Active] in the store. A caller who receives [Storage Failure] from [Revoke] must not assume the grant is revoked; the revocation must be retried. See *Revoke persistence failure* in Edge cases.
- *Concurrent [Revoke] calls resolve by compare-and-set.* The [Active] → [Revoked] transition is a guarded compare-and-set on `status = active`, committed as a single write under the host environment's serialization guarantee, so two concurrent revokes cannot both succeed — the first wins, the second receives [Not Active].
- *Rejection priority is fixed.* For [Revoke] the order is [Not Known] → [Not Active] → [Storage Failure]; for [Grant] it is [Invalid Request] → [Storage Failure]. The full per-action preconditions are in Decision points.

### Flow

1. **An administrator or composing pattern issues a grant.** Calls [Grant] — the atom records the grant in [Active] and returns the id.
2. **Time passes; the grant persists.** The host system stores the [Grant Id] alongside whatever policy or role record necessitated the grant.
3. **An action is attempted.** The composing pattern calls [Check] before allowing the action. [Permitted] → proceed; [Denied] → refuse.
4. **At some point, the grant is withdrawn.** Calls [Revoke]. The grant moves to [Revoked]; subsequent [Check] queries for that (subject, scope) pair no longer see it.

### Decision points

- **At [Grant]** — [Subject Ref] and [Action Scope] must each contain at least one non-whitespace character; otherwise [Invalid Request]. The atom does not prevent duplicate [Active] grants for the same (subject, scope) pair — two independent grants covering the same scope are two records with distinct ids, both active. If the grant store write fails after all preconditions pass, the atom returns [Storage Failure] — no grant is recorded. Durability of the grant store is implementation-owned; a [Storage Failure] response guarantees no partial record was written.
- **At [Revoke]** — [Grant Id] must reference a known grant; otherwise [Not Known]. The referenced grant must be in [Active]; revoking an already-revoked grant is rejected as [Not Active]. If the state transition ([Active] → [Revoked]) computes successfully but the store write fails, the atom returns [Storage Failure] — the grant remains [Active] in the store. This is a security-critical failure mode: a caller who receives [Storage Failure] from [Revoke] must not assume the grant is revoked; the revocation must be retried. See *Revoke persistence failure* in Edge cases.
- **At [Check]** — no precondition; [Permitted] and [Denied] are both first-class outcomes, not rejections. A [Permitted] result with an empty active-grant set is structurally impossible — the atom returns [Denied] any time no [Active] grant matches. The query is read-only and produces no state change.

### Behavior

Observed behavior, derived from how access control systems are actually deployed:

- A [Check] query is answered entirely from the [Active] grant set. No grant → [Denied]. The composing system is responsible for calling [Check] before acting; the atom does not enforce that the call happens.
- Multiple [Active] grants for the same (subject, scope) pair are allowed and are independent. Each has its own [Grant Id], [Granted At], and revocation lifecycle. Revoking one does not affect the others. [Check] returns [Permitted] as long as at least one [Active] grant matches.
- Revocation is immediate and terminal. After a successful [Revoke], the grant moves to [Revoked] and [Check] queries against that grant's (subject, scope) no longer include it. The grant record remains observable (for audit purposes) but no longer contributes to evaluation.
- The atom does not implement explicit deny. Absence of an [Active] grant is denial; there is no "deny" grant that overrides an active "allow" grant. Explicit-deny semantics belong to a Policy Layer composing pattern that wraps the evaluation surface.
- The [Action Scope] is evaluated by exact match on the opaque scope value. The likely objection: "exact match is useless without scope hierarchy — a grant for `documents:read` should cover `documents:read:public`." The mechanism: scope vocabulary is defined entirely by the composing system. OAuth (the OAuth open authorization standard) scope strings, RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) role names, ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) policy keys resolved to canonical strings, resource-type/action pairs — all work without modification, because the atom makes no assumption about scope structure. The result: any scope model composes with this atom without requiring the atom to understand scope semantics; hierarchy, wildcards, and inheritance live in the layer that defines the vocabulary, not in the grant store.
- When [Check] returns [Permitted] and multiple [Active] grants exist for the queried (subject, scope) pair, the return value does not indicate which grant matched. This is by design — [Check] is a pure query that returns a first-class outcome, not a data dump. Composing systems that need to know which grant authorized access (for audit logging, for selective revocation) query the [Active] grant set directly for the ([Subject Ref], [Action Scope]) pair. The grant store is queryable; the composing system picks the detail level it needs.
- [Check] with empty or malformed inputs returns [Denied] rather than rejecting. An empty [Subject Ref] or [Action Scope] matches no [Active] grant by definition, so the result is structurally [Denied]. [Check] has no rejection path — both outcomes ([Permitted], [Denied]) are first-class results.
- The atom does not record who issued a grant. Grantor attribution — *which administrator granted this, under which policy* — belongs to Actor Identity composing with [Grant] (recording an attestation at grant time). The bare atom records the grant, not the authorization to grant.
- **Time and id are injected at the seam, not generated inside the transition.** Per the Logic Confinement Principle (`execution-contract.md`), the host reads the clock and allocates the [Grant Id] at the deployment seam before the transition runs; [Granted At] and [Revoked At] are stamped from the injected [Now], and the core transition reads no wall clock and mints no id internally. This is the determinism the execution contract requires, and it leaves the caller signatures ([Grant], [Revoke], [Check]) unchanged.

### Feedback

Each successful action produces an observable, measurable change:

- After [Grant] — a new grant appears in [Active] with a fresh [Grant Id], the supplied [Subject Ref] and [Action Scope], and [Granted At]. Total grant count increases by one. Active grant count increases by one. The id is returned.
- After [Revoke] — the grant at [Grant Id] moves to [Revoked] with [Revoked At]. Active grant count decreases by one; revoked count increases by one; total count unchanged.
- After [Check] — no state change. The atom returns [Permitted] or [Denied].

Each rejected [Grant] or [Revoke] action produces an observable refusal: [Invalid Request] or [Storage Failure] (for [Grant]); [Not Known], [Not Active], or [Storage Failure] (for [Revoke]).

The full grant set — [Active] and [Revoked] — is queryable. Per-grant fields ([Grant Id], [Subject Ref], [Action Scope], [Granted At], [Status], [Revoked At]) are observable to auditors and administrators; whether end-users see them is presentation policy of the host system.

### Invariants

The following invariants (conditions that must always hold, regardless of what sequence of actions has occurred) constitute the verification surface of the pattern:

- **Invariant 1 — Grant immutability.** Once recorded, a grant's [Grant Id], [Subject Ref], [Action Scope], and [Granted At] never change. [Granted At] is stamped once from the injected [Now] at grant time and is never re-derived from the current clock.
- **Invariant 2 — Status monotonicity.** A grant's [Status] transitions only in one direction: [Active] → [Revoked]. No grant returns from [Revoked] to [Active].
- **Invariant 3 — Revocation is terminal.** Once a grant is in [Revoked], no [Revoke] call will succeed for that [Grant Id] ([Not Active]), and no [Check] query will return [Permitted] on its basis.
- **Invariant 4 — Id stability.** A grant's [Grant Id] is set on [Grant] and never changes.
- **Invariant 5 — No id reuse.** No two grants share a [Grant Id] across the lifetime of the system.
- **Invariant 6 — Evaluation self-containment.** [Check] over a ([Subject Ref], [Action Scope]) pair is determined entirely by the [Active] grant set at query time. No out-of-band data is consulted.
- **Invariant 7 — Denial by absence.** [Check] returns [Denied] if and only if no [Active] grant exists matching the queried ([Subject Ref], [Action Scope]) pair.
- **Invariant 8 — Revoked grants confer no permission.** For any grant in [Revoked] state, no [Check] query returns [Permitted] on its basis, regardless of its ([Subject Ref], [Action Scope]) values.
- **Invariant 9 — Timestamp ordering.** For any grant in [Revoked] state, [Granted At] ≤ [Revoked At]. This invariant is best-effort under non-monotonic clocks; if the underlying clock moves backward (NTP adjustment, clock skew), the inequality may be violated. The implementor is responsible for the clock discipline that makes it hold; see Edge cases.
- **Invariant 10 — Grant store durability.** Grants are never deleted from the store. [Revoke] transitions a grant from [Active] to [Revoked]; it does not remove the record. The total grant count is monotonically non-decreasing. A [Grant Id] returned by a successful [Grant] call is durably persisted; a [Storage Failure] rejection guarantees no partial record was written. This invariant is the formal counterpart of the Generation acceptance bar — "no grant is missing from the store" — and is what makes point-in-time authorization reconstruction possible.

Evaluation self-containment and denial by absence together give the *determinism* property — [Check] is a pure function of the [Active] grant set at query time; the same query against the same active set always returns the same result. Grant immutability and status monotonicity together give the *auditability* property — the full authorization history of every grant is recoverable from the grant store alone, without recourse to logs, snapshots, or developer narration.

## Examples

The same atom, five domains, identical mechanic.

### Banking — segregation of duties on high-value transfers

Regulatory policy requires that no single employee can both initiate and approve a wire transfer above $25,000. Two grants are issued at onboarding: `grant(teller_t9, initiate:transfer) → grant_id g1` and `grant(supervisor_s4, approve:transfer) → grant_id g2`. When teller_t9 attempts to approve their own wire, the system calls `permitted(teller_t9, approve:transfer)` — `denied`. Only supervisor_s4 holds an active grant covering `approve:transfer`. SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act) requires this segregation to be demonstrable from records; the grant store is that demonstration.

### Healthcare — HIPAA minimum necessary access

A hospitalist physician is granted access to records for patients under their direct care: `grant(dr_chen, records:ward-7-patients) → g14`. A billing clerk holds a narrower grant: `grant(clerk_b3, records:billing-fields-only) → g22`. When the billing clerk attempts to open a full patient chart, `permitted(clerk_b3, records:ward-7-patients)` returns `denied`. When Dr. Chen's patient is discharged and transferred, the hospitalist grant is revoked: `revoke(g14)`. Subsequent `permitted` queries for Dr. Chen return `denied` for that ward's records. HIPAA (US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) §164.312(a)(1) requires access controls that limit access to the minimum necessary; the grant store is the audit surface.

### Payments — PCI DSS restricted cardholder data access

PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard — the card networks' mandatory security rules for handling cardholder data) Requirement 7 mandates that access to cardholder data be restricted to individuals whose job requires it. A fraud analyst is granted access: `grant(analyst_a6, cardholder-data:read) → g31`. A customer service representative is not granted this scope; `permitted(rep_r12, cardholder-data:read)` returns `denied`. When the analyst rotates teams, the grant is revoked: `revoke(g31)`. A QSA (Qualified Security Assessor — a PCI-certified auditor) audit calls `permitted` for every employee against the cardholder-data scope and expects to see `denied` for all but the explicitly granted staff; the revocation record shows when access was removed.

### Legal — role-based document access in a matter

A law firm's document management system grants associates access to documents in matters they are staffed on. `grant(associate_j, documents:matter-2024-91) → g55`. A partner on a different matter is not staffed: `permitted(partner_k, documents:matter-2024-91)` → `denied`. When the associate is rolled off the matter, `revoke(g55)` — subsequent access denied. Opposing counsel's discovery request asks the firm to demonstrate who had access to the matter documents and when access was withdrawn; the grant store provides the timeline.

### Source control — branch protection in regulated software

An FDA-regulated (US Food and Drug Administration — the federal agency regulating drugs and medical devices) medical-device team restricts merge access to the `release` branch. `grant(release_engineer_r, branch:release:merge) → g88`. Developers hold only `branch:feature:merge` grants. `permitted(developer_d, branch:release:merge)` → `denied`. When the release engineer changes roles, `revoke(g88)`; a new engineer is issued a fresh grant: `grant(new_release_engineer_n, branch:release:merge) → g91`. The FDA's 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations — the codification of US federal agency rules) Part 11 software validation requirements are satisfied in part by demonstrating that only authorized personnel can modify the release artifact; the grant store is that demonstration.

The mechanic is identical across all five. What differs: the scope vocabulary (account:approve vs. records:ward-7 vs. cardholder-data:read vs. documents:matter vs. branch:release:merge), the lifecycle of grants (long-lived role grants vs. short-lived patient-panel grants), the regulatory consequence of [Denied], and the composing patterns active around it (Actor Identity for grantor attribution, Event Log for access-attempt logging, Retention Window for how long the grant store must be kept).

### Regulated adversarial scenarios

Three scenarios the atom must survive in regulated contexts:

- **Regulator audit — who has access to what.** A HIPAA auditor asks *"which staff have access to full patient records?"* The auditor queries the grant store for all [Active] grants covering the patient-records scope. The grant store answers from stored fields alone — [Subject Ref], [Action Scope], [Granted At], [Status] — with no recourse to developer narration. Invariants 1, 6, and 7 are the structural answer: evaluation is self-contained; every active grant is observable; absence of a grant means denial.
- **Disputed access — was this actor permitted at the time of the action?** An actor claims they were not authorized to access a resource at a specific time. The investigator queries the grant store for grants where `subject_ref = actor_ref` and `action_scope = contested_scope` with `granted_at ≤ time_of_action` and (`revoked_at IS NULL OR revoked_at > time_of_action`). The timestamp-based form is preferred over `status = active` because [Status] reflects current state, not historical state — a grant revoked after the time of action has `status = revoked` now but was active then; the timestamp condition captures it correctly. A grant matching those criteria is the structural answer: the actor held an [Active] grant at the time of the action. Invariants 1 and 9 make the timeline reconstruction exact.
- **Privilege escalation investigation — unauthorized access attempt.** A security incident suggests an actor accessed a resource beyond their grant. The investigator queries [Check] against the grant store as it stood at the time of the incident. [Denied] at that query confirms no [Active] grant existed — any access that occurred did so by circumventing the authorization surface, which is the security incident's scope, not the atom's. The grant store's integrity determines whether the authorization record can be trusted; composing with Tamper Evidence makes that determination structural.

---

## Non-goals and edge cases

What this atom does not cover:

- **Role management.** Roles — named collections of scopes assigned to subjects — are a composing RBAC (Role-Based Access Control — permissions granted to roles, which actors are then assigned) pattern. The bare atom deals in direct grants; a role is a shorthand that the composing system resolves into a set of grants before calling [Grant].
- **Attribute-based policy evaluation.** Evaluating whether an actor's attributes (department, clearance level, time of day, resource sensitivity) satisfy a policy expression belongs to an ABAC composing pattern.
- **Scope hierarchy and wildcard matching.** A grant for `documents:*` does not automatically cover `documents:read` in the bare atom. Scope semantics — wildcards, prefix matching, inheritance — belong to the composing system's scope vocabulary. The atom does exact match.
- **Explicit deny.** There is no `deny` grant that overrides an active `allow` grant. Absence of grant is denial; explicit-deny semantics belong to a Policy Layer composing pattern.
- **Delegation and grant inheritance.** A subject granting their own permissions to another subject belongs to a Delegation composing pattern. This atom does not prevent it, but it does not model it; the delegating grant and the delegated grant are independent records.
- **Time-bounded grants.** A grant that expires at a deadline belongs to a Temporal Grant composing pattern. This atom records [Granted At] but does not model expiry. If a grant should expire, the composing system is responsible for calling [Revoke] at the right time.
- **Grantor attribution.** The atom does not record who issued a grant. Grantor identity — *"which administrator authorized this grant?"* — belongs to Actor Identity composing with the [Grant] action (producing an attestation alongside the grant record). The atom records the grant; Actor Identity records the authorization to grant.
- **Access attempt logging.** The atom does not log [Check] queries. Whether an access was attempted, by whom, and what the result was belongs to an Event Log composing pattern. The bare atom answers the query; the composing system decides whether to record that the query was made.
- **Actor registration and lifecycle.** [Subject Ref] is opaque. Whether an actor exists, is active, or has been deprovisioned is handled by an Actor Registry.
- **Authentication.** Whether the caller is who they claim to be belongs to an Authentication composing pattern. This atom does not verify that the [Subject Ref] passed to [Check] corresponds to the authenticated caller — that binding is the composing system's responsibility.
- **Mass revocation on subject deprovisioning.** When a subject leaves an organization or is deprovisioned, every one of their [Active] grants must be individually revoked by [Grant Id]. The atom provides no bulk-revocation surface. A composing system that issues `revoke(one_grant_id)` and considers the subject deprovisioned has left every other [Active] grant for that subject intact — the subject still has access. The operational pattern for deprovisioning is: enumerate all [Active] grants where `grant.subject_ref = departing_subject`, then call [Revoke] for each. This is the composing system's responsibility; the atom records every grant individually and revokes individually.
- **Concurrent grant proliferation.** Multiple simultaneous [Grant] calls for the same pair produce multiple distinct [Active] grants. Unlike [Revoke], there is no serialization race — both succeed and each returns a distinct [Grant Id]. Composing systems that intend to issue a single authoritative grant should guard against concurrent issuance (e.g., by checking for an existing [Active] grant before issuing a new one), or should model multiple grants as an acceptable policy state.
- **Concurrent grant modification.** Multiple simultaneous [Revoke] calls for the same [Grant Id] resolve serially: the [Active]→[Revoked] transition is a guarded compare-and-set on `status = Active`, committed as a single write under the host environment's serialization guarantee, so two concurrent revokes cannot both succeed — the first wins, the second receives [Not Active].
- **Revoke persistence failure.** If the [Active] → [Revoked] transition is computed but the store write fails, the atom returns [Storage Failure] and the grant remains [Active] in the store. Unlike a [Grant] storage-failure (where the consequence is a missing record), a [Revoke] storage-failure has direct security consequences: the subject retains access they should not have. Callers must treat [Storage Failure] from [Revoke] as an unresolved state requiring retry — not as a confirmed revocation. High-assurance deployments should instrument [Revoke] storage-failure as a security alert and implement automatic retry with idempotency-safe semantics (retrying a successful revocation returns [Not Active], which is distinguishable from the original [Storage Failure]).
- **Clock semantics.** [Granted At] and [Revoked At] are wall-time stamped from the injected [Now] (see Inputs and Behavior). Clock skew, NTP adjustments, monotonicity, and timezone handling are deployment-layer properties the spec does not address. Invariant 9 ([Granted At] ≤ [Revoked At]) is best-effort under non-monotonic clocks; a clock that moves backward between [Grant] and [Revoke] can violate the inequality. Trusted timestamping (RFC 3161) is a composing pattern that supplies a verifiable time-anchor if the timeline must be adversarially defensible.
- **Cross-system permission portability.** [Action Scope] is opaque and system-local. Federating grants across trust domains belongs to an Identity Federation composing pattern.

Where the atom breaks down: when the scope vocabulary is not expressible as exact opaque references (requiring hierarchy or wildcard matching); when the permitting system must reason about resource attributes at evaluation time (requiring ABAC); when grants must be time-bounded without external revocation (requiring a Temporal Grant wrapper); when the identity of the grantor matters to the evaluation (requiring Actor Identity composition to record the authorization to grant).

## Terms

The canonical concepts this spec refers to. Each `[Term]` marker in the prose above links to its card here. A card states what the concept *is*, in plain English, plus its **Kind** — one of four: **Type** (a thing or category), **Operation** (a behavior), **Member** (a value of an enumerated Type), or, for a named datum, **Field** (a datum a Type carries — *what does it carry?*) or **Parameter** (a value an Operation needs — *what does it need?*). A card also names the Type it is a **Member of** / **Field of**, the Operation it is a **Parameter of**, and its **Role** where the domain assigns one. A card carries one **Projects** line — the concept's single canonical lowering token, the one place the concrete name stays visible on the page — for every Field, Parameter, and pinned/wire Member. Everything else about casing (each target's snake / camel / pascal / const / wire form) is **derived** from that one token by [`tools/harness/term-adapter.mjs`](../tools/harness/term-adapter.mjs), never hand-written. *(annotation.md Terms registry; representational only — it changes no guarantee, invariant, or behavior of the atom above.)*

#### Grant

The behavior an administrator or composing pattern invokes to record a new grant binding a [Subject Ref] to an [Action Scope]. It allocates a fresh [Grant Id], stamps [Granted At], records the grant in [Active], and returns the [Grant Id]. It always creates a new record — duplicate grants for the same (subject, scope) pair are independent records, each with its own id.

Kind: Operation

#### Revoke

The behavior that withdraws a recorded grant, by id. It moves the grant at [Grant Id] from [Active] to [Revoked] and stamps [Revoked At]. Revocation is terminal: a grant already in [Revoked] is rejected with [Not Active].

Kind: Operation

#### Check

The read-only behavior a composing pattern invokes before an action to evaluate whether a (subject, scope) pair holds an [Active] grant. It returns [Permitted] if any [Active] grant matches the queried [Subject Ref] and [Action Scope], otherwise [Denied]. It changes nothing and never rejects — both outcomes are first-class results. (Its projected contract lowers the verb to `permitted`; see Inputs.)

Kind: Operation

#### Grant Id

The opaque, immutable identity of a grant, host-allocated at the I/O seam on [Grant] and never reused. The [Subject Ref] and [Action Scope] are properties of the grant, not its identity; the id is the handle [Revoke] uses.

Kind:     Field
Field of: Permissions
Projects: grant_id

#### Subject Ref

The opaque reference to *who* holds the grant — the subject the grant binds. The atom does not interpret it; the actor registry is a separate concept. Set on [Grant], immutable thereafter, and matched byte-exactly by [Check].

Kind:     Field
Field of: Permissions
Projects: subject_ref

#### Action Scope

The opaque reference to *what* the grant covers — the scope the grant binds. The composing system defines scope semantics; the atom does exact match on the value (no hierarchy or wildcard). Set on [Grant], immutable thereafter.

Kind:     Field
Field of: Permissions
Projects: action_scope

#### Granted At

The wall-time the grant was recorded, stamped from the injected [Now] on [Grant]. Immutable thereafter, and never re-derived from the current clock.

Kind:     Field
Field of: Permissions
Projects: granted_at

#### Status

The grant's lifecycle state — [Active] or [Revoked]. Set to [Active] on [Grant]; transitions one-way to [Revoked] on [Revoke].

Kind:     Field
Field of: Permissions
Projects: status

#### Revoked At

The wall-time the grant was revoked, stamped from the injected [Now] on [Revoke]. Absent while the grant is [Active]; set once on [Revoke] and never changed after.

Kind:     Field
Field of: Permissions
Projects: revoked_at

#### Now

The current wall-time reading the transitions stamp [Granted At] and [Revoked At] from, supplied to the pure transition by the host at the I/O seam (never read inside the transition, never supplied by the business caller).

Kind:         Parameter
Parameter of: Grant
Projects:     now

#### Active

The state of a grant that is in force: it contributes to [Check] evaluations. A grant enters [Active] on [Grant] and leaves it only on [Revoke].

Kind:      Member
Member of: the grant state
Role:      Outcome
Projects:  active

#### Revoked

The state of a grant that has been withdrawn: it no longer contributes to [Check] evaluations. A grant enters [Revoked] on [Revoke]; the transition is terminal — there is no [Revoked] → [Active] path.

Kind:      Member
Member of: the grant state
Role:      Outcome
Projects:  revoked

#### Permitted

The outcome [Check] returns when at least one [Active] grant matches the queried [Subject Ref] and [Action Scope]. A first-class result, not a success-or-reject acknowledgement.

Kind:      Member
Member of: the Check outcome
Role:      Outcome
Projects:  permitted

#### Denied

The outcome [Check] returns when no [Active] grant matches the queried pair — denial by absence. A first-class result; empty or malformed inputs also resolve to [Denied], since they match no [Active] grant.

Kind:      Member
Member of: the Check outcome
Role:      Outcome
Projects:  denied

#### Invalid Request

The refusal [Grant] returns when [Subject Ref] or [Action Scope] does not contain at least one non-whitespace character. A guard rejection that fails before any store write; no grant is recorded.

Kind:      Member
Member of: the Grant rejection
Role:      Outcome
Projects:  invalid-request

#### Not Known

The refusal [Revoke] returns when the supplied [Grant Id] references no grant the store holds.

Kind:      Member
Member of: the Revoke rejection
Role:      Outcome
Projects:  not-known

#### Not Active

The refusal [Revoke] returns when the referenced grant is not in [Active] — it is already [Revoked]. This is what makes revocation terminal and what a serialized second concurrent revoke receives.

Kind:      Member
Member of: the Revoke rejection
Role:      Outcome
Projects:  not-active

#### Storage Failure

The refusal [Grant] or [Revoke] returns when the store write fails after all preconditions pass. For [Grant], no grant is recorded. For [Revoke], the grant remains [Active] — a security-critical state the caller must retry, never treat as a confirmed revocation.

Kind:      Member
Member of: the action rejection
Role:      Outcome
Projects:  storage-failure

## Composition notes

Permissions is freestanding and is designed to compose with the authorization and identity atoms:

- **[Actor Identity](./actor-identity.md)** — records *who authorized a grant or revocation* (the grantor attribution concept). Calling [Attest](./actor-identity.md#attest) alongside [Grant] produces a verifiable non-repudiation record for each grant issuance. The composing system stores `attestation_id` alongside the [Grant Id]. The [Attributed Permissions Admin](../compositions/attributed-permissions-admin.md) composition formalizes this wiring as a named composition with eight emergent invariants (including attribution completeness, revocation attribution, attestation exclusivity, and orphan-log durability) and a dynamic Alloy trace model verifying its temporal claims.
- **[Event Log](./event-log.md)** — records access attempts. Each [Check] query result can be appended as an event: `{subject_ref, action_scope, result: "permitted" | "denied", at}`. Neither this atom nor Event Log requires the composition; the host system decides whether to log.
- **[Retention Window](./retention-window.md)** — the grant store and its audit history must be retained for the regulatory lifetime of the system. SOX, HIPAA, and PCI DSS each specify minimum retention periods for access-control records.
- **[Tamper Evidence](./tamper-evidence.md)** — the grant store is a target for privilege escalation attacks. Cryptographic hash chains, Merkle-tree commitment, or external anchoring make any rewrite of the grant store detectable from the records alone.
- **RBAC / Role Management** *(forthcoming)* — named roles as collections of scopes. The role manager resolves a role assignment into a set of [Grant] calls and a role revocation into a set of [Revoke] calls.
- **ABAC / Policy Evaluation** *(forthcoming)* — attribute-based policies that resolve to [Permitted]/[Denied] by evaluating subject attributes, resource attributes, and environmental conditions against a policy expression. Wraps or composes with the grant surface.
- **Delegation** *(forthcoming)* — a subject granting a subset of their own permissions to another subject for a bounded scope and duration.
- **Temporal Grant** *(forthcoming)* — grants that expire at a deadline, triggering automatic revocation at expiry.
- **Actor Registry / Identity Provisioning** *(forthcoming)* — supplies the actor lifecycle that determines when [Subject Ref] values are valid. Deprovisioning an actor should cascade revocation of their grants; that cascade belongs to the composing system.
- **Authentication** *(forthcoming)* — verifies that the caller is who they claim to be before [Check] is called. The binding of authenticated identity to [Subject Ref] is the composing system's responsibility.
- **[Audit Trail](../compositions/audit-trail.md)** — the full regulated-audit composition (Event Log + Actor Identity + Retention Window + Tamper Evidence) applied to the grant store itself: every grant and revocation is recorded, attributed, retained, and tamper-evident.
- **[Multi-Party Approval](../compositions/multi-party-approval.md)** — calls `Permissions.permitted` for chain-level authorization: the composition checks that the initiating actor holds the required scope before `initiate_chain` is accepted, and applies the scope vocabulary defined in Multi-Party Approval's Composition logic to govern who may initiate, withdraw, or read chains.
- **[Session-Gated Authorization](../compositions/session-gated-authorization.md)** — gates every `Permissions.permitted` call on Session validity. The composition calls `Session.validate` before the Permissions check; a stale or revoked session returns `session-invalid` before Permissions is consulted.

[Shared Todo](../compositions/shared-todo.md) composes Permissions with Personal Todo and an Assignment atom — Permissions supplies the authorization surface that determines which actors can read or modify which tasks.

## Standards references

Permissions is a foundational access-control primitive with wide regulatory anchoring:

- **NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology — US federal standards body) SP 800-53 Rev. 5, AC family (Access Control)** — AC-2 (Account Management), AC-3 (Access Enforcement), AC-6 (Least Privilege), AC-17 (Remote Access). The atom's grant-based evaluation surface is the operational form of AC-3's access enforcement function.
- **NIST SP 800-207 (Zero Trust Architecture)** — least-privilege access per request, with explicit per-resource authorization. The atom's [Check] query per (subject, scope) is the structural form of per-request evaluation.
- **ISO/IEC 27001 §A.9 (Access Control)** — the International Organization for Standardization / International Electrotechnical Commission information-security standard; logical access control, user access management, review of user access rights. The grant store is the access-rights record §A.9.2 requires.
- **HIPAA §164.312(a)(1) (Technical Safeguards — Access Control)** — unique user identification, emergency access procedure, automatic logoff, encryption. The minimum-necessary principle (§164.514(d)) is operationalized as narrow action scopes. The grant store demonstrates compliance.
- **Sarbanes-Oxley §404 (Internal Control over Financial Reporting)** — segregation of duties, access controls on financial systems. The grant store's timeline (who had what access, from when to when) is the §404 evidence trail.
- **PCI DSS Requirement 7 (Restrict Access to System Components and Cardholder Data)** — need-to-know access, formal access authorization, denial by default. Invariant 7 (denial by absence) is the structural form of PCI DSS's default-deny posture.
- **GDPR (EU General Data Protection Regulation) Article 25 (Data Protection by Design and by Default)** — technical measures ensuring only necessary data is processed. Scoped grants are the technical measure; the grant store demonstrates the measure.
- **NIST SP 800-63-3 (Digital Identity Guidelines)** — the atom composes with Authentication (which supplies NIST IAL/AAL/FAL — Identity, Authenticator, and Federation Assurance Levels — assurance levels) and with Actor Identity (which records the authorization-to-grant event).

It inherits from:

- **Daniel Jackson, *The Essence of Software*** — freestanding-atom posture; the discipline of composing authentication, identity, role management, and policy evaluation as separate atoms rather than absorbing them.
- **Eiffel's design-by-contract** — preconditions on [Grant] and [Revoke]; named rejection reasons.
- **Lampson's access matrix** (1971) — the foundational formal model of access control as a matrix of (subject, object, right) triples. [Grant] adds a right to the matrix; [Revoke] removes it; [Check] queries it. The atom is the structured-natural-language realization of Lampson's core operations.
- **Graham-Denning model** — formal treatment of grant and revoke as eight first-class protection operations. Grant and revoke are two of Graham-Denning's eight; the atom isolates those two (plus evaluation) as the minimal authorization surface.

## Generation acceptance

A derived implementation of Permissions is *acceptable* — in the regulator-acceptance sense — when an external auditor, given the grant store, can do all of the following without recourse to source code, runbooks, or developer narration:

- **Enumerate every grant, active and revoked, with its full history.** [Grant Id], [Subject Ref], [Action Scope], [Granted At], [Status], and [Revoked At] (where applicable) are present and queryable for every grant ever issued. No grant is missing from the store.
- **Reconstruct the authorization state at any past point in time.** Given a timestamp, the auditor can determine which grants were [Active] at that moment by filtering on `granted_at ≤ t` and (`status = active` or `revoked_at > t`). The timeline is exact (Invariants 1 and 9).
- **Confirm denial by absence.** For any ([Subject Ref], [Action Scope]) pair where no [Active] grant exists, [Check] returns [Denied]. The auditor can verify this directly from the grant store — no [Active] grant matching the pair means [Denied], structurally, with no exceptions (Invariant 7).
- **Confirm revocation is terminal and immediate.** For every revoked grant, [Revoked At] is present and `status = revoked`. No [Check] evaluation after [Revoked At] returns [Permitted] on the basis of that grant (Invariant 3).
- **Identify composing patterns active in this deployment.** Whether grantor attribution (Actor Identity), access-attempt logging (Event Log), retention (Retention Window), and tamper-evidence on the grant store (Tamper Evidence) are wired in, and with what configuration.

This is the generator's contract: any code generated from this atom must produce a grant store and an evaluation surface that pass the five checks above. The bar is the regulator's question — *"who has access to what, since when, and who authorized it?"* — not the developer's intuition.
