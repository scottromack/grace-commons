---- MODULE credential-buggy-toctou ----
\* Grace Commons — Credential atom: BUGGY TWIN (vacuity guard) — Invariant 2.
\* Mirrors credential.tla (execution/render-time refactor, 2026-06-21).
\*
\* This is the second of two isolated buggy twins. It targets Invariant 2
\* (EFFECTIVE-active uniqueness under concurrent register) by reintroducing the
\* time-of-check/time-of-use (TOCTOU) hazard. Its sibling `credential-buggy.tla`
\* targets Invariant 7 (rotation-chain integrity). Splitting the hazards across
\* two twins gives each load-bearing invariant its own reachable, checker-rejected
\* counterexample — a combined twin would surface only the shorter violation,
\* leaving the other invariant unverified.
\*
\* BUG — non-atomic register (TOCTOU against the effective-Active guard): the
\* uniqueness guard reads the injected clock at CHECK time but the commit does not
\* re-check. RegisterObserve marks a slot "checking" while EffActiveCount(now) = 0;
\* RegisterCommit makes it Active without re-checking. Two concurrent registers
\* both observe EffActiveCount = 0 and both commit -> two EFFECTIVE-Active
\* credentials. Inv_EffectiveActiveUniqueness is violated. `rotate` here is the
\* CORRECT atomic form (it sets the successor link), so Inv_RotationChain still
\* HOLDS — the violation is isolated to effective-active uniqueness. If the checker
\* reports all invariants hold here, the Inv 2 check is vacuous.
\*
\* This is the refactor's analog of the original duplicate-active-credential
\* TOCTOU, now phrased against the read-time effective-Active predicate: the guard
\* that must use injected `now` is split from its commit, so the time-of-check
\* value of the clock no longer governs the committed write.
\*
\* Read against Capability requirement 8 (2026-09-13): the correct model's
\* RegisterAtomic is the critical section over the pair, check and write in one
\* step, and this twin is that section's absence. No index appears in either
\* model. Re-checked 2026-09-28: checked alone, Inv_EffectiveActiveUniqueness
\* is violated and Inv_RotationChain holds.
\*
\* Expected result: Safety VIOLATED (Inv_EffectiveActiveUniqueness).  Sequence:
\* RegisterObserve(1), RegisterObserve(2) (both see EffActiveCount = 0),
\* RegisterCommit(1), RegisterCommit(2) -> two effective-Active credentials.

\* `checking` is a transient interim stored value used only to split the register
\* TOCTOU; it is still a STORED value (never "Expired"), so Inv_NoStoredExpired
\* holds for it and the hazard stays isolated to effective-active uniqueness.
