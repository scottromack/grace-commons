-- provenance.als
-- Alloy structural model for the Grace Commons Provenance atom
-- (atoms/provenance.md)
--
-- PURPOSE
-- Verify the load-bearing structural invariants of the Provenance atom by bounded
-- exhaustive search. The model encodes the custody chain of ONE artifact as a
-- linear sequence of entries and verifies:
--   (a) custody continuity / no gap (Invariant 4) — the load-bearing claim,
--   (b) single origin (Invariant 3),
--   (c) archived-is-terminal/absorbing (Invariant 6),
--   (d) the linear-chain backbone (Invariants 2/5 — append-only, total order),
--   (e) custodian presence (Invariant 7) and event-type validity (Invariant 8).
--
-- MODELING APPROACH (mirrors atoms/observation.als)
-- Static structural snapshot. Each Entry is one custody record. The chain is a
-- directed linear relation (successor/predecessor). `holder` is the current
-- custodian in effect immediately AFTER an entry (the cached current_custodian
-- projection, here made explicit per entry so continuity can be checked
-- structurally). Custody continuity is the hand-to-hand rule across every link:
-- the custody coming INTO an entry equals the custody going OUT of its
-- predecessor. For a Transferred entry the incoming custody is `fromC`; for any
-- other entry it is `holder` (unchanged). A Transferred entry sets the new
-- holder to `toC`.
--
-- NOT MODELED HERE
-- - Clock semantics / recorded_at ordering (sequence_number is the order source;
--   linear position models it; Invariant 5 is the linear backbone)
-- - Cryptographic tamper-evidence (Tamper Evidence — composing concern)
-- - Non-repudiable custodian identity (Actor Identity — composing concern)
-- - Disclosure scope/authority (Selective Disclosure — composing concern)
-- - Storage-failure atomicity (implementation obligation, not a structural invariant)
-- - Multi-store routing / id-uniqueness across stores (deployment concern)
--
-- HOW TO READ THE RESULTS
-- Every "check A_*" should return UNSAT ("No counterexample found") — the
-- guarantee holds for all configurations in scope. Every "run Show*" should
-- return SAT — the configuration space is non-empty (no fact over-constrains).
-- A check that returns SAT is a spec finding; a run that returns UNSAT means the
-- facts are too restrictive.
